# Sales Rep Portal Access

### Access <a href="#_toc116940207" id="_toc116940207"></a>

Sales reps are allowed access to the portal using the URL for the portal which clients use but instead ending with login.aspx, they will use login\_sales.aspx. For example, https://XXX.navigahub.com/Portal/Client/XXX/login\_sales.aspx. The rep’s login information is the same as the Naviga ad login.

When the rep logs into the portal, he will see a list of his own accounts and can click on any of them.

Once the sales rep clicks on the account hyperlink, the rep is in the client’s account logged in as the client. The rep can then view all orders, invoices and contacts which the client views.

### Client View <a href="#_toc116940208" id="_toc116940208"></a>

The rep view of the customer portal allows the rep to drill down on a client and (1) view and add notes, (2) view and add to-do items and (3) view recently closed to-do items. The Portal format also now renders accurately in a cellphone format.

Click on one of the clients in your list as a rep. Click the tab “Contacts”.

Click the “Add to Do” button.

You can then create the to-do items on the list and save the action item. The action item is added to the list.

You can close an item by using the “Close This Item” button and also add notes by using the “New Note” button.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and you see a view at the completed action items and a list of the client portal users for this client.

In all these screens, you can use the blank box under each column to filter on the different values to narrow down the results.

Scroll down the advertiser screen and the sales rep can view and manage opportunities for the client.

### Create Advertiser <a href="#_toc116940209" id="_toc116940209"></a>

A Salesrep can create an account for an advertiser from the rep’s homepage.

Click “Create New Account”.

System alerts you if there is a duplicate. Once it’s cleared that this is not a duplicate, the system prompts you to create a primary contact for the advertiser.

Note that once you enter a partial name of the client, the system searches for nearby business using google search engine to assist in finding the client name.

Once the details of the account settings are filled in, the system provides you with the account ID and navigates to the account view.
