# Client Portal Access

Once the setup is complete, clients can begin to access the portal. (See Portal Setup [HERE](./))

## How Your Clients Can Use the Portal <a href="#_toc116940167" id="_toc116940167"></a>

### Login and Home Page <a href="#_toc116940168" id="_toc116940168"></a>

As the advertiser, login to the portal, using the username and password created by the media company for you as their client. You will view the home page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1443).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The home page provides the main icons for users to navigate to the following:

* “Specials” - which are the remnant package orders created by the media company.
* Invoices - show invoices available for view and payment
* Orders are for print, digital and exhibitions available for viewing, managing materials, and sending messages to the company you’re advertising with.
* Proposals & renewals can be managed from the Proposals icon.
* Materials for the orders are also available for view and management from the materials icon.
* The forms icon enables the advertiser to fill in custom data forms assigned to them by the media company.

Also on the home page is a list of messages from the client to internal users of the system, as well as any responses. See below for more info on Messages.

### Messages

In the client portal the client can send messages from various places –

* On the Message Center page (landing page on a normal login) – here they can create any type of message (related to an invoice, existing order, new order, etc)
* On the orders page (digital orders or print orders) – click on the link to manage the order and there is a button to Add/View Comments. This only displays on _upcoming_ orders.
* On the Orders Page (exhibitions) click the Order # of an upcoming show and there will be the same Add/View Comments that we have on ad orders
* On the invoices page, there is a notes icon next to each invoice – this will create a message related to that invoice.

Portal Messages are displayed on 5 screens inside Naviga Ad for internal users –

* In A/R & Credit Control on the “Controller Home” page
* In Advertising on the Production Home screen
* In Advertising on the Advertising Home screen (only displays here if I am NOT viewing as “Executive Home Page & Dashboard” in User Security)
* On the customer overview screen, on the Sales CRM tab and the Accounting tab
* In Setup -> Admin -> Portal Setup -> Portal Messages

On the first three screens in the list above, the list is filtered to show only what is assigned to the logged in user. On the customer screen, it is filtered to show only messages from that customer. The Portal Messages screen under Portal Setup menu will show all messages along with a column to display the user ID of the user to whom it is assigned.

See Portal Setup for more on [Message setup and routing](./#message-routing).

### Orders <a href="#_toc116940171" id="_toc116940171"></a>

Click the icon “orders”.

This screen gives you a view of the running, upcoming, and recently completed print and digital orders, as well as exhibition orders.

The screen provides a hyperlink to the order which will display in the template chosen as per the setup done by the system administrator.

#### Add/ View Messages <a href="#_toc116940172" id="_toc116940172"></a>

When looking at an order, click the Add/View Comments to send a message or reply to a message

From this screen, you can create a new message by clicking “Submit a New Message”.

Type the subject, and message text in the appropriate boxes. Note that there is a reference to the order. You can also reply to a message from your rep using the reply button. The rep will see these messages in Naviga Ad.

#### Change Material on the Order <a href="#_toc116940173" id="_toc116940173"></a>

For a print ad, Click the icon “change material on order”; and a pop up with all this advertiser’s material appears. For a digital material, the button says "Attach Existing Material," but the functionality is similar. Only materials marked as "Accepted" from preflight will be displayed in the material selection window.

You can filter by Headline, Description, or order number by typing in the blank box.

Click the “Select” button under the desired material and this will update the order with the new material.

#### Replace with New Material <a href="#_toc116940174" id="_toc116940174"></a>

You can upload new material for each order. Click on the order hyperlink and then click the button “Replace with New Material”. This allows you to upload a PDF, JPG or TIF file with the material in it no more than 25MB.

Enter a headline, description of the material and any production notes you need. Then click on Upload File.

Click on “OK” when the confirmation message that file has been attached displays. The material displays validation in progress message while it is going through preflight. Once it is approved from preflight, the material will be displayed in the Portal and the user will be able to use it for pickups as well.

For a digital material the process is similar, but the button says "Submit new Material." Click the size from the drop-down and note that these sizes which display are the ones which are a match between the material size and the line item size. Otherwise, the other sizes will not display.

You can mark that the ad is a video or animated by clicking the “Yes/no” button. Enter production notes in the box if any, and click on “Upload File”, which attaches the material to the order. If the material type is HTML5 or 3rd Party tags, the file prompt disappears and a text box appears for them to enter in the code.

#### Order Performance <a href="#_toc116940194" id="_toc116940194"></a>

Clients and users of the Advertiser Portal are able to view the performance of each of the orders. In the “Orders” tab, under the “Current/ Running Orders” the system provides a link to manage the order.

Click the link to manage the order.

The screen provides the summary to the performance of the order. Click the “?” icon by the “Performance Summary” title. A pop-up screen displays helpful information on how to read the pergormance gauge. This provides also the 3rd party actuals if applicable.

Access to this feature is determined for all your clients from within Naviga Ad as some users may not wish their clients to be able to view this information. In the system, navigate to the Advertising module’s menu Setup -> Admin -> Portal Setup -> Portal Setup.

### Materials <a href="#_toc116940177" id="_toc116940177"></a>

User clicks the materials icon and will be able to view all materials available

User can click the image to view the image of the ad. You can also change out materials for the orders using the same procedure as above when viewing an order.

On the Ratecard line user sets a Material Size Code and sets these on the Material Records. When assigning material to the order, the portal will return any unexpired material that has a preview image, and that has a matching Material Ad Size Code to the Ratecard line on the order., as long as that material is marked as having passed Preflight.

User can also add new materials to an order from the Advertiser Portal through each order.

#### Material Approval <a href="#_toc116940178" id="_toc116940178"></a>

The system allows user to send materials to the Portal clients for approval and keeps track of the approval audit trail.

Navigate to edit an existing or create new material in Naviga Ad. Select Production menu -> New Material -> or View/ Edit Materials. Scroll to the Approval shutter.

Click the “[Approval Status](../../naviga-ad-modules/advertising/production-ad/overview-ad-production-and-material-status-workflow.md#\_toc113467268)” drop-down menu and note the values that were previously configured in Approval Setup. Select a status with an internal meaning of Allow approval. (for example, "Out to Proof" or something similar might be your status. You can also add artist’s comments so that the client can view them on the Portal. Then click on the button “Send Approval Email to Client”.

The client receives this information in an email which used an email template which you can setup in Setup -> [Material Approval Email Templates](../../naviga-ad-modules/advertising/setup/material-approval-email-templates.md).

Edit the subject, and email recipients and click on Email PDF or HTML. You can also download the email instead. You can also edit the different fields in the template by clicking the View/ Edit Document.

The client can then log in to the Portal and click the Approve or Reject button in the material record. (Thumbs up or Thumbs down icons)

When the client receives the email and logs into advertiser Portal, he will see the Action column on each material which requires his approval.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1528).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The client clicks the green thumbs up or red thumbs down for approval or rejection accordingly. A pop-up screen displays to allow the client to enter a comment and click the approval button.

The material then disappears from his queue and you will see the comment and approval status and note in the material maintenance screen.

This allows you to then proceed with production. The materials production status will then change according to the setup on the Product Setup screen under Material Handling node. See [Overview - Ad Production and Material Status Workflow](../../naviga-ad-modules/advertising/production-ad/overview-ad-production-and-material-status-workflow.md)

In the Portal / Material Approval Integration section, choose the approval and rejected stage statuses and the users to notify when this takes place. Once the material is approved or rejected, its status changes to one of these two statuses.

### Proposals <a href="#_toc116940179" id="_toc116940179"></a>

In Naviga Ad, when there is a proposal (Campaign in a quote status) which is marked as “Ready to Sign”, then you will be able to see this proposal in the menu proposals on the client portal.

Note that the field “Signature Template” on the campaign header offers a drop-down value where you can use a pre-set template. This is the menu Setup -> Templates -> Order Confirmation Email Templates. If the template is marked as active, it will available in this drop down “Signature Template”. The template chosen will likely default from Product Setup, though it can be changed on the campaign header if desired. If the user emails the proposal to the client, whatever proposal is emailed will override what is set in the "Signature Template" field. This is so that any additional notes or manual tweaks the user makes will get displayed when the user signs the proposal.

Navigate to the portal and note that the proposal is now available for viewing under the icon “Proposals” and under the tab “Awaiting Signature”.

In the section at the bottom of the proposal where the client actually signs, the Full Name and Job Title may already be filled in based on the configuration in portal logged in user's setup. The name of the company is the client name as well as today’s date.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (379).png>)

Underneath there are three options for user:

1. **Download and Sign Later:** This will only download the proposal and allow you to sign it on paper and mail it to the company.
2. **Reset Signature**: This option will reset the signature you started before you approve the contract and will clear the signature line.
3. **Approve this Contract:** Use the mouse and keyboard to sign the proposal on the screen and then click the “approve this contract”.

Implement option 3 to sign the contract and approve this contract. Make sure that you enter your full name in the Full Name field as well as Title and Company if not already pre-filled.

A confirmation popup appears and prompts you to proceed with download a copy (downloads a PDF), approve another contract (in the same way), return to the main page or Prepay this campaign.

Click the button “Return to the Main Page”.

Click the “Proposals” icon and note that now this proposal moved from the tab “Awaiting Signature” to the tab “Signed Contracts”. If the client didn't already prepay for the campaign at the time of signature, he can also come to the Signed Contracts tab and select one or more campaigns to pre-pay for with a credit card. See [below ](client-portal-access.md#prepay-campaign-via-a-pay-link-from-naviga-a-d-user)for step-by-step guide to prepaying campaigns on the portal

If a proposal is invalid for any reason, for example it sits on the client portal past the issue close date, it will be marked as invalid and the sales rep can then clean up the invalid ones or take the appropriate action. It will also not be valid if the inventory is no longer available.

### Invoices <a href="#_toc116940181" id="_toc116940181"></a>

Click the icon “Invoices”, and a list of open and paid invoices display under the corresponding tab.

PDF links are available for each invoice.

You can also click the icon for adding a note to an invoice. This note will be viewable also in the message center, when you click the icon “messages”.

The sales rep sees the client messages in Setup -> Admin -> Portal Setup -> Portal Messages. This will also give the rep hyperlinks to the orders in question.

#### Paying invoices in the Portal - The Client Experience

In the Advertiser Portal, the customer user's invoice and campaign payment experience will be dependent upon whether or not processing fees are enabled and whether or not ACH is enabled.

To show the different user experiences to be expected in the Portal, I will show different portal activities, each with three different scenarios:

1. Fees are not enabled, and the bank is NOT set up for ACH (this method is the behavior that was available in prior releases)
2. Fees are not enabled, and the bank IS set up for ACH
3. Fees are enabled, and the bank IS set up for ACH&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
IMPORTANT - IF you are using the Advertiser Portal, AND you are charging credit card fees, you MUST have ACH enabled on your bank.  You cannot charge credit card fees without giving the client the option to pay with their bank account (ACH) without fees.
{% endhint %}

### Pay invoices as a logged in user

#### Scenario #1 - No Fees, No ACH

This scenario will be familiar if you are already using the portal since it is the same as how the system behaved in prior releases.  When looking at the Invoices tab, user sees the Aging at the top of the screen and when they click on Show invoice options, the screen will change and user can select which invoices, and how much, they would like to pay.  Demo below walks you through the process (For best results view in full screen by clicking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top right corner):

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/WeM_knijvrNKNnuGDSt3V" %}

#### Scenario #2- No Fees, with ACH

Same screen as above, but this system has enabled ACH in their Bank processor. (They also added the option to display COA and Pre-payments in the aging, but that is related to portal setup and not relevant to the Fees/ACH discussion).  When User clicks on the Show Invoice payment options button they will first be presented with an option to pay with cash (ACH) or pay with credit (credit/debit card). Demo below walks you through the process for paying with each method.  For best results view in full screen by clicking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top right corner

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/uLhvrwZJDGy6QGSUy5b31" %}

#### Scenario #3 - With Fees, with ACH

Same workflow as above, but this system has enabled Fees in A/R system settings, and has ACH in their Bank processor.  In this workflow, there is no aging totals at the top, because the amounts will differ based on payment method, which might confuse the user.  When User clicks on the Show Invoice payment options button they will first be presented with an option to pay with cash (ACH) or pay with credit (credit/debit card). Demo below walks you through the process for paying with each method.  For best results view in full screen by clicking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top right corner.

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/IailGrPprYd4dWK_Xuax-" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
IMPORTANT - if you are using the "Individuals with Portal Access" functionality (set up via Setup -> Portal Setup -> Individuals with Portal Access) - we have temporarily turned off the ability to pay in the portal.  This functionality will be brought back in 2024, but it needed to be re-worked to support all the new payment features and wasn't working as expected in 2023 software so it is disabled for the time being to avoid customer confusion.  They will still be able to see their invoices and download copies, but they will not be able to pay in the portal.
{% endhint %}

### Pay invoices without logging in via a pay link from Naviga Ad User

#### Scenario #1 - No Fees, No ACH

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/hvYJBA9XP1vBWG5khJWer" %}

#### Scenario #2- No Fees, with ACH

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/wgz8-VxnCAnVoaYwtAY6h" %}

#### Scenario #3 - With Fees, with ACH

If a customer wishes to pay an invoice without logging in, a system user can send them a pay link from Naviga ad. Demo below walks you through the process for paying invoices with a pay link.  For best results view in full screen by clicking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top right corner.

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/4aJw-0XZITznyhXJeyHjq" %}

### Prepay Campaign via a pay link from Naviga Ad User

As long as the campaign has not started billing, and is no longer a quote, a pay link can be sent from the payments and invoices node on a campaign.  If the campaign is a quote, the user can send the client a proposal with a link to approve the proposal.  Once the proposal has been signed, the user will be offered the option to pay, if the Portal settings allow for prepayment. The three demos below walk you through the process in each of our three scenarios. For best results view in full screen by clicking the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top right corner.

#### Scenario #1 - No Fees, No ACH

#### Scenario #3 - With Fees, with ACH

{% embed url="https://app.supademo.com/demo/dzJHcZHDtivej3inpnGcf" %}

#### Including Portal Link on Invoices <a href="#_toc116940184" id="_toc116940184"></a>

The portal link can be provided on the invoice which user receives to allow user to pay the invoice online. (note, this is different from Paylinks, where an internal user initiates link directly to the invoices, bypassing the need to login. The Portal Link on the invoice still requires the user to authenticate to pay online)

As a prerequisite, there are some conditions that must be in place for the link to display on the invoice:

1. Setup Client Access menu: Customers that have their invoice emailed must have the contacts with access to the portal entered here.
2. The Bill to Invoice Delivery Method must be set to email or email/print.
3. The invoice must have an amount greater that zero.
4. Only one portal link should be defined on the invoice form and it should be placed in the header section of the form.

Please note that in the HTML template section titled \<!-- #VARIABLE\_PORTAL\_PAY\_START# --> and \<!-- #VARIABLE\_PORTAL\_PAY\_END# --> tag, the link will only be included when invoice is to a customer that is already signed up on the portal. If you want all customers to see the portal URL do not not use the HTML tag above, but rather hard code the Portal URL into the invoice form. You will only see the link in the email that is sent, so in order to test, you must email the invoice then open the email and you will see the link.

### Forms

Custom data forms can be used in the portal for clients to provide information, either about themselves or about a campaign they are going to be running. See [Custom Data Forms](../../naviga-ad-modules/advertising/setup/custom-forms-setup.md#\_toc115263573) for information about setting up new forms.

Then from the client portal, the client will be able to see available and completed forms

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (685).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The customer can select and then fill in the form and submit their responses:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1007).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (634).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At the bottom of the form the customer can save if they wish to complete later or can save and submit. Upon submission, if it is an opportunity form type, then the sales rep on the opportunity will receive a CRM Alert and an email. If it is related to an order line, the rep on the order will receive the CRM Alert and email and the Production Controller on the campaign will also receive an email.

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: for internal users, you can set up image and file/document upload question types on forms. These are not yet supported on the portal.\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (758).png>)
{% endhint %}

Internally, on the form, there is now a history so you can see who saved it and when and whether or not the customer submitted the form.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (635).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Campaign Renewal for Portal Clients <a href="#_toc76060696" id="_toc76060696"></a>

You can [create renewal notices](../../naviga-ad-modules/advertising/campaigns/expiring-campaigns.md#\_toc61858165), using the renewal forms in Naviga Ad and send to your clients, and in turn they can choose which campaigns to renew. If the user is a Portal user, they will receive an email with the link and sign the renewal from the Advertiser Portal.

#### Renew from the Portal <a href="#_toc76060702" id="_toc76060702"></a>

Once the client logs into the Portal, the campaign due to be renewed is visible even if the rep hasn’t sent a renewal notification. These appear under a separate node on the Proposals tree. Note that the campaign initially doesn’t have an ID because it hasn’t been renewed yet.

The client can then change the start date by entering the new date in the slot above the order using the calendar icon and click “Change Start Date”.

The order then adjusts the dates by refreshing and displaying the start date. It adjusts the end date to match the expired campaign length. The order also applies the line items to the available issues from the new start date to match the expired campaign.

The client can then scroll to the bottom and sign the contract.

Note that the future print issues must be preset in Naviga Ad and the renewed order uses the same rates as the expired campaign.

Once the client signs and approves the contract, the campaign disappears from the Renewal list and displays in the signed contract tab with a new campaign ID.

So, in essence, the Ad Portal returns a list of Proposals for the logged in user. The list of Proposals is composed of the following:

1\. Proposals flagged to appear on the Portal

2\. Campaigns that had a renewal request sent to the advertiser

3\. Campaigns the system thinks should be renewed

Here’s an explanation of how the system selects each of the above:

**Proposals flagged to appear on the Portal:**

Selection criteria for Campaigns:

* Must be a “Q” status (Q1/Q2/Q3)
* Must be flagged as “Ready to Sign” (this is a checkbox on the Campaign Setup screen)
* Must start after today
* Must NOT be flagged as “Signature Received” (this is a checkbox on the Campaign Setup screen)
* Must be in a Product Group that matches the Product Groups on the Portal Profile
* Must have a value greater than zero

**Campaigns that had a renewal request sent to the advertiser**

Selection criteria for Campaigns:

* Must have had a renewal sent in the last 30 days
* Must NOT have already been renewed
* Must be in a Product Group that matches the Product Groups on the Portal Profile
* Must have a value greater than zero

**Campaigns the system thinks should be renewed**

* Must have an end date within “x” number of days (as defined on the Portal Profile, default is 30 days)
* Must have a Campaign status that matches those defined on the Portal Profile (default is Confirmed or Billed)
* Must NOT have already been renewed
* Must NOT have had a renewal sent to the Advertiser
* Must be in a Product Group that matches the Product Group on the Portal Profile
* Must have a value greater than zero

## Controlling what the client sees about their orders <a href="#_toc116940185" id="_toc116940185"></a>

On the orders and materials screen, there is a list of orders where the client can click on "manage this order" and a screen will open up with details about that order. The details that are displayed are controlled by the templates configured in Setup.

### Exhibition Template Setup <a href="#_toc116940185" id="_toc116940185"></a>

This is the exhibition template to be stored in the Exhibition module, Setup menu -> Forms and Templates -> HTML Templates -> Create New and create a new portal template.

The HTML template is then defined as the exhibition template to use by navigating to the Advertising module menu Setup -> Admin -> Portal Setup -> Portal Setup.

In the “Order View Templates” section, choose the same template you create for exhibition in the “Exhibition Order Template”. Click on “Save”.

### Digital and Print Template Setup <a href="#_toc116940187" id="_toc116940187"></a>

In the Ad module -> Templates -> Order Confirmation Email Template.

Create a new template and copy and paste the html code above into the editor. Change fields as you see fit. Save the template.

Navigate to the setup menu -> Admin -> Portal Setup -> Portal Setup.

Choose this template from the drop down menu for Print Order Template. Save the settings.

## Client Purchases Package on Portal <a href="#_toc116940192" id="_toc116940192"></a>

Once you create the package, the client will be able to purchase it by navigating to the Portal and then click the tab “Specials”.

Check the box for the package you want to purchase and then click the button “Buy Selected Items”.

Follow the prompts to pay for the package or postpone the payment to a later time. You can also add a payment method as needed.

You can then print a PDF receipt.
