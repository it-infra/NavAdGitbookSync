# Accounts Receivable & Credit & Collections

Review Campaign Billing Process:

* Prepare Performance Billing
* Prepare Flexible Billing
* Generate Invoices
* Print Invoices
* Campaign Problems

The system offers a workflow to assist in following up on unpaid invoices. Collection stages can be standardized, and letters set up to mass email to debtors.

* Collection Workflow/Stages\
  For better tracking collection efforts, set up a desired collection workflow. For example, one may choose to first send out emails, later perhaps make phone calls, and finally send a client to a collection agency.
* Collection Letters\
  Templated emails can be used to automate the collection process.
* Credit Control Assignments\
  Customers can be assigned to different collectors to manage collection efforts.
* Import Credit Control Notes\
  You may optionally import historical collection information into the collection notes area.

Invoices and credits are generally created from within the order billing process. There may be a requirement for miscellaneous debit and credit memos that are not reflected in advertising reports. A/R Miscellaneous invoicing can be used to produce AR credits or debits.

* A/R Invoices
* Class Codes\
  Class codes are used as shortcuts to GL codes in the finance system. Users do not need to type debit and credit GL codes, they can shortcut data entry using class codes. If historical financial data is to be imported, class codes will be required for that import.
* Miscellaneous Products\
  If miscellaneous invoicing is to be used on an ongoing basis, default product descriptions, with optional price defaults and a tie to the appropriate class code will need to be created.
* A/R Invoice Import\
  Importing opening balances (or unpaid invoices) allows for accurate statements and for cash receipts of legacy invoices and invoices billed in Naviga all in Naviga.
* A/R Payments
* A/R Payment Import\
  For most implementations, only unpaid invoices are imported, and historical payments are not uploaded. However, payments may be imported on an ongoing basis from data provided by your bank. Depending on your requirements a custom import may be required, or this standard template can be used.
* A/R Miscellaneous Invoice Templates\
  These templates are used if miscellaneous invoice transactions are to be sent to customers.
* A/R Payment Receipt Templates\
  One may optionally choose to print receipts for payments received. If this functionality is used, you can create custom HTML receipt templates.
* A/R Statement Templates\
  If statements are sent to clients, these templates can be customized. Default statements can be used system wide, with custom statements at the client level, or by selecting a statement form at the time of processing.
* Customer Service/CRM Templates\
  Default email templates can be created to standardize and speed up communications with customers. These templates are used in the collections process.
* A/R System Parameters\
  These important rules manage A/R setup, automated emails and customer defaults.
* Batch Type Setup\
  When entering cash batches, one may choose to identify a batch type to provide additional reporting layers. For example one may choose to enter all EFT in one batch and credit card payments in another.
* Credit Card Processing Gateway\
  If you choose to process credit cards through Naviga, or through the Naviga customer portal, there is an optional credit card interface. Naviga will need information regarding your merchant account in order to complete initial setup. The required information varies depending on the processor.
