# Pricing Methods

Pricing, inventory, reporting, financial recognition, and layout/ad server interfaces are all driven by the setup of the ratecard. The ratecards will be assembled using previously created codes and will have a substantial impact on the way in which business rules are applied.

* Ratecard Header/Detail\
  In campaign entry ratecards provide easy selection of item descriptions, dimensions, GL allocation, pricing rules, default pricing and possibly section and position information.
* Ratecard Export/Import\
  For ease of setup, ratecards can be created in Excel and uploaded into the system. Existing ratecards can be exported, manipulated in Excel and then imported to create new ratecards.
* Frequency Discount Schedules\
  There are various ways to discount pricing, and many options in how rate tables can be set up. This allows you to set up discount schedules that can be applied to rate tables if you wish to make them available in campaign entry.
* Price Adjustments\
  Optional price adjustments can be created and applied in campaign entry. Depending on setup, one may choose to display adjustments on order confirmations and on invoices.
* Automated Price Adjustments\
  If separate price adjustments are required, they may be set to automatically apply to certain ratecard line items. This provides the adjustment for reporting, without requiring manual adjustment entry.
* Display Package Setup\
  Packages provide a powerful shortcut in order entry and optionally may also be used to control pricing. These are not essential for go live but it may be useful to have some examples to use in end user training.
* Incentive Setup\
  This tool is intended to assist in upselling to customers. Business rules can be set to determine what campaigns are eligible for additional discounts, and what discounts are offered if additional items are selected. Users will be notified in campaign entry of applicable incentives that can then be applied as a campaign discount.
* Classified Category Template Setup\
  As discussed classified category templates allow for default pricing for classified ad entry. Pricing is controlled using ratecards. The classified ratecards are set up slightly differently than the display ratecards.
* Expense Types\
  For some campaigns you may wish to track expenses associated with the campaign. The campaign revenue is distributed based on the GL types, if you wish to report on the profitability of a campaign you may wish to use these codes to track the expenses. For those using the Naviga accounts payable system these codes may be set to integrate sales and expenses, when not using Naviga payables these will be used to provide an additional reporting layer
* Order Confirmation Email Templates\
  If you choose to send insertion orders/confirmations from the system you will need to set up forms that can be emailed to the client.
* Marketing Content Templates\
  These are optional inserts to the order confirmation forms, allowing for more flexibility in adding a temporary marketing message to confirmations.
* Invoice Form Logos\
  You may create different forms for different product groups, or upload logos and insert them into the same invoice template to differentiate your forms.
* Invoice Forms\
  A sample invoice form is provided; you can customize invoice forms if you wish. You may choose to use one invoice form or to set up a different form for each group of advertising products. For invoices that are emailed you can set the default design for the email cover letter.
