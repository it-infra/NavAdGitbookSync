# Preprint/Insert and Classified/Liner Ad Setup

If you are selling zoned inserts most of the zone setup will be applied at the product level, however some decisions will need to be made prior to setting up your publications. There are also some general setup rules for liner ads that need to be completed prior to setting up publications where liner ads can be sold. This section can be skipped if you do not sell these kinds of ads.

* Zone Dimension Setup\
  The actual delivery zones are set up at the product level. This setup allows us to determine what delivery counts should be applied to each zone. One can track up to five segments of readers, such as: subscribers, non-subscribers, retail etc.
* Zone Groups\
  For ease of entry zones may be grouped into larger areas. For example, one may set up the greater metro area, within that group designate various neighborhoods and within those set up the detailed zones.
* Zones with Audience Numbers By Date Range/Issue\
  There are two zone imports. One creates the zones and assigns circulation by issue. The other creates the zones and assigns circulation by date range. Use whichever import best suits your business rules in order to set up zones and assign the accurate circulation counts.
* Classified Category Setup\
  The classified sections are setup using these categories. Categories can be nested to any level desired and business rules are managed at the category level. Metadata/fielded data can be applied to each category. For example, one may sell help wanted liner ads, and these may be divided into for example full and part time employment. Each of these categories may require set questions in order to create the ad.
* Classified Category Template Setup\
  Classified category templates allow for default stylesheets and default pricing for classified ad entry. For example, a "good" template may have a different style than a more expensive "better" template. Pricing is controlled using ratecards (to be discussed in next training session) We will provide more pricing information in the next training session.
* Liner Entry Html Templates / Code Blocks\
  Optional liner entry code blocks allow for more flexibility when manually designing ads within Naviga. For example, one may create a template with default settings and also create code blocks that users can drop into the template instead of manually defining styling at the time of order entry.
* Assign Classified Categories to a product\
  All categories may not be sold in all products. This step allows for attaching categories to the appropriate products.
* Classified Packages\
  Classified packages are used to streamline classified entry across multiple products. They may also be exposed on the customer portal to allow clients to easily select a package. These can be used to set the days and products on which the line is delivered and may be priced at a flat fee.
* Affidavit Templates\
  For legal liner advertisements, some publishers offer notarized proof that the ad was published, if needed once can create templated forms to use to send affidavits to advertisers.
* Optional Classified Self Service Setup\
  If the classified self-service portal is being implemented, additional setup will be required before customers can enter their own classified ads. These would include: Classified portal setup, default email templates, moderation words and phrases.
