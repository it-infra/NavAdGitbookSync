# Customer Portal and Production Workflow

To provide your customers with visibility to their orders, invoices, proposals and statements you can implement the customer facing portal that works directly with the Naviga Advertising system. Via the portal, customers can pay invoices, upload artwork or pickup repeat copy and assign it to orders. You may wish to implement this after you are comfortable with using the system internally, and you may not choose to implement all parts of the portal at once. The production workflow tool allows one to manage materials and provides automation and reporting to monitor the status of ad trafficking/copy chasing. The ability to upload materials to the system is tied to the customer portal and the production tools can be used in conjunction with the customer self-service tool to help manage material. The production workflow also manages the flow of components to artists for advertising that is created in house.

* Client Access Setup\

* Production Workflow Stages\
  Workflow rules are managed by assigning a status to each line item that designates the state of the creative for an order. For print orders production workflow stages are managed for each issue within a campaign line item.
* Production Workflow Status Reminders\
  One can tie to each stage reminders that can be bulk emailed to clients.
* Production Workflow “Master Stages”\
  For ease of reporting the product specific Production Workflow Status Stages can be summarized across all products using a master stage grouping.
* Artists Setup\
  Artwork that is created in house can be assigned to artists for workflow using InDesign extensions. Artist information is set up in this area. The InDesign extension will need to be provided to the artist for install on their computer.
* Artwork Production Workflow Status\
  This status is linked to the artwork itself and is what the artist selects from within InDesign. These status are displayed in InDesign and are only relevant when using the Naviga InDesign extension for material creation. Artwork set at a completed status in InDesign will flow back to Naviga. This table is shared across all products integrated with InDesign.
* Material Approval Codes\
  These codes are also linked to the material and can be auto-selected based on what production workflow status is selected. These codes can also trigger if the material should be available in the portal for the customer to approve and can be used to determine if artwork should be sent to NavigaPlan.
* Material Approval Configuration by Product\
  Different business rules can be applied to different products. A daily product may well have a different approval process than a weekly or monthly product.
* Component Tags\
  Artwork components such as logos or other images can be stored on the customer. You may also choose to store global components. When selecting components for artwork one can select from customer specific or global components. Component Tags are used to classify and categorize component data. You can use any number of these tags on each component record in the system to assist in searching for components. --
* Naviga Plan Integration\
  If you are using Naviga Plan for page layout, this screen will control Plan settings including setting which order status should cause orders to flow to Naviga Plan.
* Production Reminder Templates\
  HTML templates are used to assist in communicating with customers. The templates are set up in this area and attached to the appropriate product material stages.
* Material Approval Email Templates\
  These templates are used to present in house artwork to clients for approval via the customer portal.
* Material Templates\
  This allows us to save the Template that was used to create a Classified Ad – in case we need to regenerate it later.
* Production Links\
  One can optionally store URL’s for specific production information. If these are set up, they can be displayed on order confirmations to provide production details for each ad.
* Editorial Production Workflow Status Stages\
  This tool is like the production workflow tool but intended to manage the internal tasks necessary for creating editorial content for date based and issue-based products. Orders can be assigned to internal editorial staff and tracked through using workflow status.
