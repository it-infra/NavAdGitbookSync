# Initial System Setup

System tables provide some general dropdown lists that may be used in various places in the system. These tables will need to be populated prior to setting up products such as newspapers, magazines or websites. In this session we will also show you how to access the software and how to navigate screens so that you can start your setup.

* System navigation:\
  How to move around the system, where to find setup tables.
* Production vs Sandbox:\
  You will have access to two separate databases, the data in production is considered permanent, data in the sandbox can be overwritten periodically.
* GL Levels & Accounts:\
  Please see additional documentation on GL codes. These codes will need to be set up in Naviga even if you are using an external general ledger system. Codes can be set up manually or imported.
* Revenue Categories\
  These are optional GL code categorizations that provide an additional reporting layer if desired.
* GL System Parameters:\
  System rules for the GL, including intercompany GL codes for multicompany environments
* Companies/Legal Entities:\
  Information needed to allow for a multi-company environment if you do have separate legal entities.
* Financial Periods:\
  Setup of the periods for your fiscal year, including start dates and earliest needed financial period.
* Set Open Periods:\
  Initially we will allow import and entry into any financial period, after go live you will limit open periods.

  Address rules are set by country, for example rules on lengths of fields, requirements for postal codes and telephone formats etc. You can also create a list of reasons to select from when changing names/addresses.
