# Shared Advertising Tables

The following codes are set up and can then be applied to each product as desired. By creating the entire list of available codes, one can more quickly set up each advertising product by simply selecting the appropriate codes for that product. For example, one creates a list of all advertising sizes for any product, be it on website, print or enewsletter. When creating the product only the applicable sizes would be selected for that product.

* Salesrep Setup\
  A table of sales representatives allows for tracking of commissions and crediting sales to the appropriate person. Reps may or may not also have a user ID allowing access to the system, if needed the login information will be set up elsewhere. These codes are used for advertising reporting, not to determine system access.
* Salesrep Budgets\
  Sales budgets can optionally be established to track actual versus projected revenue/sales goals. The sum total of rep budgets may be used to report on product budgets, stand alone product budgets will be discussed in a later session
* Product Formats & Invoice Template Line Groups\
  For enhanced reporting each product is assigned a format. For example, you may have scheduled e-newsletters, custom eblasts, monthly publications, daily newspapers. These formats provide another layer in reporting and a way to group different products of the same type together. Once the formats are set up for your internal reporting, you can also group them for display on invoices if you wish.
* Advertising System Parameters\
  Business rules for the advertising part of the system, including email cover letter for invoices.
* G/L Types\
  These are shortcuts to GL codes that are used to track different lines of revenue for your advertising products. By using the GL type as a shortcut, we can simplify setup and allow ratecards to be copied from one product to another while using the appropriate GL from the product. GL types must be set up before you can set up Ad Types. GL types can be shared across all products and tie to GL codes by product.
* Ad Serving Platforms\
  These can be used when setting up ad types and will default on to each digital line in campaign entry. This allows for reporting on which lines were serving on other non-GAM servers. These are not required but can provide additional reporting and a link to additional questions needed for each server. Examples would be: Facebook, YouTube etc.
* Ad Types\
  These codes are used for reporting different types of sales and for governing how ads are priced and how ads are pushed to the ad server. For example, one may have a CPM ad type versus a Sponsorship/Tenancy/Flat Fee ad type. The ad types offer a powerful reporting tool, impact the questions asked in campaign entry and impact how data is sent to page layout and ad serving systems. Ad types must be set up and are required fields in campaign entry. The primary function of an ad type is to determine rating, for example flat fee, CPM/CPC, Cost per Unit, Cost per Inch/CM, Cost per Word/Visible Line/Agate Line. The ad types also drive fulfilment such as: digital serving platform, GAM attributes, liner vs display creative, and if the line paginates. Ad types may limit discounting and agency/rep commission. Ad types are not directly associated with column widths, placements/positions or customer types.
* Order Status Codes\
  The system allows for pipeline reporting using order status. The status steps are set by the software, you can use this table to manage the status descriptions to better manage your reporting.
* Size Setup\
  This table allows for creation of size descriptions/dimensions for all advertising. These sizes may be for set print sizes such as full page, or dynamic print sizes such as per column inch/cm. Dimension type relates to both width and depth allowing for ads that may span multiple columns. Line equivalence is used for reporting and inventory. Setup is also needed for digital sizes such as 300x250 banner and should be set up for all creative. The entire list is created here, and later assigned to the appropriate product(s). These sizes will drive pricing and will be used in page layout and ad serving systems.
* User Defined Fields\
  If additional data is needed in setting up a campaign (or a campaign line) you may wish to create your own questions for data entry. Rules can be set to manage the questions and format them by date, as a number or as a text field. Fields can be set to be required or optional and can allow for only one answer or for multiple answers.
* Custom Data Forms\
  Custom forms allow for creation of a set of user defined fields that can be tied to various business processes. For example you may create a set of questions for orders that are fulfilled via other platforms for additional questions in order entry creating a streamlined communication to the external provider.
* Holiday Calendars\
  These are used primarily for enewsletters and allow specific dates to be blocked out so that one cannot accidentally sell a newsletter for a date on which it will not be distributed.
* Print Color Setup\
  If you wish to track color on print orders, color definitions can be setup up and defaulted in to ratecard lines or applied in order entry. If you are using Naviga Plan, you will need to populate the number of colors column with the codes used in Plan. The codes are: 0 = bw, 1 = yellow, 2 = magenta, 3 = magenta + yellow, 4 = cyan, 5 = cyan + yellow, 6 = cyan + magenta, 7 = cyan + magenta + yellow = full color
* Column Layout Maintenance\
  If you are interfacing to a page layout system, you will need to define column formats for all print products. The column measurements would include gutters and should allow for double page spreads. Default column formats are applied to each print product, they can be overwritten by each section in the product if required.
* Trade Types\
  If you wish to track trade/barter deals in detail the system allows for creation of a trade receivable and more detailed reporting of trade deals. If you have minimal trade, you may skip this section.
* Engagement Codes\
  These Social Media Engagement codes are assigned to a product. They can then be used in Order Entry and in Actuals Reconciliation. These can be used for any metrics beyond the standard clicks and impressions - for example: Emails Sent, Unique Opens, Total Opens, Tweets, Retweets, Shares, Likes, Comments, etc.
* Affiliate Setup\
  This table allows for optional tracking of relationships with associations/contract publishing partners if needed. This section can be ignored if you do not participate in shared publishing contracts.
* Material Edition Splits Setup\
  If any print products split advertising in different editions of the publication, the definitions of the edition splits are set up here and then as appropriate applied to each publication.
* Audience Setup\
  Enewsletters may be sent to different audiences, if so and you wish to be able to manage the information in the advertising system you can set up each audience under these codes.
* Slack Channel Setup\
  There are several places in the system where business rules can create automated emails. Optionally on some business rules one can create slack channel alerts. The actual rules will be set at the product/product group level. This is the initial setup to allow Naviga to write to your designated slack channel.
* Ticketing System Setup\
  This is an additional tool to assist in internal communications. Tickets may be assigned at the campaign/campaign line item level. The tickets can then be updated and monitored in the system. This functionality is most often used to assist in tracking tasks that require action from multiple employees. The associated fields are:
  * Ticket Type
  * Ticket Priority
  * Ticket Status
