# Product Setup

While the settings listed above are global to all products in the software, most of the business rules and setup are at the product level. These are the areas of setup for each website /enewsletter /magazine /newspaper /event or other advertising product. Many codes are dependent on previous setup. Depending on your business needs some setup may be at the product group level, some at the product level. In some cases (for example GL codes) you may choose to do both. In our discussions we will help provide some recommendations on how to set up each product within the appropriate group(s).

## Product Group Setup:

Product groups are used as an additional layer in reporting to make it easier to select multiple products. They are also used to streamline campaign entry and can be used to assign default salespeople. A campaign can only be for one group of products; however, products can be placed in multiple groups if desired.

* Product Group Details
* GL Details
* GL Refund Details
* Order Entry Rules
* G/L Overrides
* Email Notifications
* Endemic Industry Codes
* Invoice Forms

## Product Setup

Each product is set up with its own details and business rules. The fields below are set up for each product. It is helpful to review your media kits and other product information prior to our meeting so that we can work through concrete examples together.
