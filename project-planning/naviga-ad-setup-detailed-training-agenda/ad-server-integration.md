# Ad Server Integration

The Naviga software is designed to provide digital billing, pipeline and order entry, and reporting options. The software optionally offers an interface to Google Ad Manager allowing for creation of campaigns in Naviga and automated synchronization of actuals from GAM to Naviga.

* General Connection Setup\
  For the Naviga software to be able to communicate to your instance of GAM, please create an administrator level user in your GAM instance named dfpadmins@msgl.com We will use this login to initialize the connection.
* Profile Business Rule Settings\
  This screen allows you to manage how the Naviga-GAM integration will function. Setup is required in order to activate the integration.
* Cross Reference Tables\
  Once the setup is initialized, Naviga will import the setup information from your GAM instance and allow visibility in Naviga for setup and campaign entry. Some fields will require a translation from the GAM codes to the codes that have been set up in Naviga.
