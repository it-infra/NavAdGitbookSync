# CRM Implementation

### **CRM Review** <a href="#_toc93569609" id="_toc93569609"></a>

Naviga Advertising incorporates a full feature CRM tool that allows managers to monitor the entire sales process from early leads to the completed sale. Demographic and historical data is used to compare buying patterns of individual customers and how they compare to other customers in the same industries to drive additional sales opportunities. The CRM module ties into the full-service customer portal that allows customers to sign contracts, upload artwork and pay invoices. We will review system functionality which includes: Customer and Contact Information, Creating an Opportunity, Converting Opportunities to Proposals, Converting Proposals to Orders, Interaction with Customer Portal, Email integration, Reports & Tools.

* Customer and Contact Information
* Creating an Opportunity
* Converting Opportunities to Proposals
* Converting Proposals to Orders
* Customer Portal

### **General CRM Code Table Setup** <a href="#_toc93569610" id="_toc93569610"></a>

The following codes are intended to provide additional CRM data related to customers, contacts, opportunities and proposals to assist sales and additional sales opportunities.

* CRM System Parameters\
  These are general system rules that govern the way in which the CRM system operates.
* Names Sources\
  If you wish to target market customers based on where they were found, these codes can help track the source of the lead. For example, you may have first encountered a customer in a competitor publication, you may subsequently meet them at a trade show. A default source code can be set if desired.
* Job Titles\
  Job titles are added to contacts to help target-marketing based on the role people play in an organization. This can be used as an exact title but is more often used to define a role or category for use in generating data. For examples, titles such as, Owner, Executive, Sales Rep, Marketing Manager and so forth. The user selects a code from the drop-down list and if they wish they can overwrite the job title description.
* Name Titles\
  This table is used to allow for management of individual name titles such as: Dr. or Ms.
* Name Removal Reasons\
  Name removal reasons are used to track why a contact was removed from a rep's list. For example, change of employer. Security can be applied to these reasons and different removals impact the extent of the removal.
* Contact Types\
  Contact types are most often used in Opportunity creation, as opposed to a job title that is more static the contact type most often refers to the contact’s role in an opportunity where they may be the decision maker, or a gatekeeper.
* Social Media Links\
  Social media links are used to define links to social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, allowing a field to store the link to the prospect’s information.
* Employee Tier Codes\
  Optional demographic codes that allow for selecting companies based on number of employees. User types in number and the system selects the appropriate tier based on setup. For example, in a range of 1 - 100 and 101 - 500 if the user types 50 the system would automatically select the 1 - 100 range.
* Revenue Tier Codes\
  Similar to the employee tier codes. Setup of revenue tiers allows for selection of companies by annual revenue.
* Department Codes\
  Optional demographic information when adding an individual to the system. One may choose to designate the employee's department.
* Action Types\
  Action Types are used to categorize the To-Do List items for a sales rep. For example, call contact, follow up in person. Types can be set with a default that determines if they should link to Google or Outlook calendars.
* Action Priorities\
  Action Priorities allow sales reps to prioritize their To-Do items and filter to do lists.
* Category Groups\
  Business categories are added to companies and contacts to help target marketing efforts based on lines of business. These categories can then be managed by grouping them. These category groups can be restricted to relevant sales reps for further organization and convenience.
* Categories\
  Business categories are added to companies and contacts to help target marketing efforts based on lines of business. For example, healthcare, manufacturing, software. Unlike the industry codes that are used for statistical reporting, multiple category codes can be assigned to a prospect.
* Primary & Secondary Industry Codes\
  Additional demographic information that may be used to further categories customers for target marketing.
* CRM Account User Defined Fields (UDFs)\
  If you wish to store additional data on prospects, you can customize these field labels and field definitions.
* Complimentary Subscription Types\
  If you are using Naviga Ad to track complimentary subscriptions, these fields allow for categorizing and adding security to comp types.
* Lead Status Codes\
  These optional codes allow for tracking the earliest stages of the sales cycle. Names can be imported to Naviga as leads and assigned to reps for the development of opportunities.
* Opportunity Types\
  Opportunity types are used to define different sales pipelines. For example, one may track different stages for new business versus renewal business.
* Opportunity Stages\
  Opportunity stages are used to define steps within each sales pipeline. For example, qualifying, lead won or lost. Stages may be set to display in the pipeline, and we recommend at least a won and a lost stage if you are using the opportunity feature.
* Opportunity User Defined Fields (UDFs)\
  User can store additional data on opportunities in these customized fields.
* Opportunity Tags\
  These provide an additional option for reporting on different kinds of opportunities.
* Required Fields On New Records\
  The system requires certain data when adding records, your business processes may require additional data to be added. These settings allow you to control the required fields in CRM entry.
* Privacy Defaults\
  Privacy default values are used to define customer privacy requests. This setting creates defaults used when creating a new prospect. Users can override the default if desired.
* Order Templates For The Customer Portal\
  The HTML signature templates can be customized to control what information is displayed.
* Customer Service/CRM Email Templates\
  Default email templates can be created to standardize and speed up communications with customers. Some examples of these custom templates would be: media kits, editorial calendars etc.
* Call Lists\
  Optional call lists may be created to track interactions with customers. These are generally added later, but may be included in initial setup.
* Marketing Campaigns\
  These campaigns may be used to measure effectiveness of marketing efforts. Campaigns are set up and then may be assigned to campaigns in order entry.

In addition to the advertising and A/R imports additional information can be imported. New customers can be created via the CRM import, and CRM data can be appended to customers created via the advertising import.

* CRM Name Import\
  This import may be used to supplement customer information already imported through the advertising name import, or may be used at any time to import prospects to CRM. A common example would be to use the advertising import to create customers and use this import to append contacts for each salesperson.
* CRM UDF/Demo Import\
  If CRM UDF are being utilized, UDF data can be appended to existing names in the system using this import.
* CRM Action Import\
  To-do items can be imported and assigned to CRM users.
* CRM Note Import\
  Free format notes or other information can be uploaded.
* CRM Comp Subs\
  Complimentary subscriptions and marketing lists can be maintained by customer, by product. If used these marketing preferences can be mass updated using this import template.
* CRM Opportunity Import\
  Opportunities can be imported and appended to customers for each salesperson.
