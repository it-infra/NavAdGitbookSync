# Interfaces / Naviga Plan

### NEXT STEPS <a href="#_toc93569611" id="_toc93569611"></a>

During the last few weeks, we have worked together to set up your system, and to import data from your legacy system(s). Once these tasks are complete, and we have developed interfaces to any external systems, you should be ready to start testing how the software supports your business processes.

Some interfaces that may need additional discussion are:

* Naviga Plan (Page layout system)
* InDesign
* External GL
* Bank Lockbox
* Credit card processor

Our next step will be training you on how to use the software. We generally train a smaller group of people to assist in testing and empower these users to be our super users and trainers for the larger team.

Once testing is complete, end users will need to be trained and we can then work together to take the system live.
