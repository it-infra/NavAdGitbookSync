# Security Settings

Rules can be set by group (and in some cases by user) to govern what a user can do in the system. Different groups can have different security and users would need to be assigned to groups accordingly. Users first need to be created, and then they need to be assigned to a group. Under the SETUP/ADMIN icon from the main menu the user groups need to be assigned Module Security (what modules can they access in the system) and Menu Security (what menu items can they access within each module). Once these are set up the groups will need specific security for each module, and each user will need user security rules set.

We recommend that user security be set to allow full system access for all users involved in setup and testing. Once you have some familiarity with the system, we will work with you to refine security.

* Create Security Groups\
  Most security is managed at the group level. Groups need to be created before rules can be applied to them.
* Module Security\
  This is the broadest level of security and controls what tiles can be seen on the login screen. A group of users can be excluded from an entire module such as GL or AP.
* Menu Security\
  Users may be granted access to a particular module but denied access to certain menu items. For example, I may be able to access the advertising part of the system but prevented access to the billing menu items.
* Group Security\
  This is the most granular level of security. Having granted access to certain menu items/business processes one may further limit user abilities via group security. For example, a user may have access to order editing but may not be allowed to edit orders that are already billed.
* User Administration\
  This is the tool that allows for creation of new users, for assisting with forgotten passwords, forcing password edits or disabling user access.
* User Configuration\
  Preferences, defaults and additional security settings can be managed at the user level. These settings should be confirmed each time a new user is added to the system.
