# Executive Summary

We are looking forward to working with you to set up the Naviga Ad system in a way that will best support your business processes. The software is intentionally designed to offer flexibility, we will be making configuration decisions and designing drop down lists to support your unique needs. The purpose of this document is to provide an outline for completing system setup and an agenda for planning our meetings.

The project team for these meetings should include people who know your current business processes and represent each area of the organization. We will be asking this team to make decisions on new business rules. It is useful to have team members attend sessions that may not directly relate to their department as decisions made in one area may have an impact on other areas of the business.

Before our meeting it would be helpful if you start to gather media kits, ratecards and any other documentation that can support the setup of the system. It would also be helpful if you start to think about inefficiencies in your current workflow that you would like to improve, tasks you would like streamlined, or approval processes that you would like enforced. The way in which we set up the system will impact what reporting is available and how data can be analysed, please keep reporting in mind as we proceed with setup.

Additional documentation is available to outline other parts of the Naviga software suite including the customer relations module, accounts payable, accounts receivable and general ledger. We may arrange additional meetings to focus on these modules if they are being used. Additional meetings may also be scheduled to focus on system interfaces and possibly to assist with legacy data imports.

Some accounts receivable and general ledger setup will be required prior to being able to set up the Naviga advertising module, even if we are interfacing to an external finance system. Planning for these setups is included in this document.

Our goal is to introduce each topic in a phone/web meeting and then to allow you time to discuss how you wish to set up the system to best work for your business. We are allowing time between sessions so that setup of one area can be done before we move on to the next topic. The order in which the material is presented is the order in which setup should be completed, later setup is often dependent on the earlier tables.

In this section of our documentation, you will find proposed agendas for each meeting and maximum time to allocate for each meeting. Should we not be able to cover all topics in the allocated time we will schedule follow up meetings to catch up.

The goal is to complete setup during or soon after these meetings complete. Next steps will be to work on data imports and interfaces to other systems including Naviga Plan page layout system and Google Ad Manager.

Within the Naviga Ad system is a System Initialization screen which will track your progress and give you an opportunity to update your progress and mark sections as being complete or partially complete.

Only Naviga personnel can mark the Naviga Completed Column. Your setup team will mark the Client completed Flag. The Percent completed field you will utilize to communicate to us and to yourselves, where you are in the process of completing your tasks. Please use the following to communicate how close you are to complete:

Once setup is complete, we will schedule system use training for the project team. The next steps will be testing, end user training, final data conversions and go live.
