# Naviga Ad Super User Training Agenda

The goal of the super user training is twofold:

Firstly, we need your team to understand how to use the system so that you can test how it will work in your business environment. This will be a test of system functions, workflow, the setup you have done, and of any integrations to external software.

The second reason for super user training is to create an internal team of system experts. Your super users will be tasked with training other end users. They will also provide the first line of expertise if end users have questions after go-live.

The more complete the setup is prior to training the better. The training is most effective when we have a full set of data that accurately reflects how you wish to work.

Because the training is conducted via Zoom it does tend to be more presentation than hands on. We strongly encourage questions during the training. The expectation is that users will spend time on hands-on practice after each session. The Naviga team can be available for the practice sessions if you wish. Questions can also be emailed or answered at the start of each training. Users will have access to recordings of the training for reference.

The training is divided into separate sessions by area of responsibility. The actual training agenda may be customized for your implementation. This is a sample agenda that we use as a planning tool.

It is recommended that implementation team members attend all sessions if possible. Knowledge of how the parts of the system interact will be useful. Topics such as creating/editing customers, entering proposals/campaigns will be covered once. These topics will impact various departments in the organization.

The setup in Naviga is used to populate data in other systems. For example, Naviga Plan relies on the setup done within Naviga to manage products, issues, sections, positions etc. The training on Naviga Plan relies on orders in Naviga to flow advertising to the page layout system.

As part of the system testing your team will also be creating sample data to test interfaces.
