# Introduction

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (285).png" alt="" width="552"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This site provides documentation for Naviga Ad, Naviga Plan, and Informer, organized by module. Navigation along the left will allow you to explore module by module as well as see Release notes for that version. Once on a specific page, navigation along the right side will allow you to jump to different topics within the page. When on a mobile device or other smaller screens, the left navigation will be collapsed, accessible via the top left menu <img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1370).png" alt="" data-size="line"> and the right navigation will not be displayed.

A Search box is provided at the top right to navigate to desired topics. There is also a toggle switch to change between light and dark mode. Hover over the Contact Naviga text for a dropdown of ways to contact us (via email, support portal, and/or form from the Naviga website).\

Note that at the top left of the screen, you will be able to select other versions. The most current released version of software will be the default when coming to the site, but you can click on the down arrow and pick a different version. Future releases will be visible a couple weeks prior to the expected release so that clients can prepare for the release - and so that those taking beta releases can access the documentation.\

Documentation for releases prior to 2023.1 will still still be accessible inside Naviga Ad in the Help menu.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation site replaces what is in the Help Index for the Digital First Platform. As of this release, only some portions of A/P module remains to be converted to this new documentation platform.

Classic Naviga Ad (Ã‰lan) will remain in the help index, as will the release notes for versions prior to 2023.1
