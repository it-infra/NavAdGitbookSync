# Accounts Receivable / Credit Control

Accounts Receivable and Credit Control are separate modules from a module security perspective, but they share the same menus. In other words, you can access the same functions, based on your security, but the landing pages when entering each module looks a little bit different. You might choose to give Finance users access to just one or both modules depending on their job function.

The **Credit Control module** is more dashboard driven, allowing for easy access to view the balances across several customer accounts to better understand who needs to be called or emailed to chase payments.

Your User Type in System Settings Module -> Security -> User Security -> Accounts Receivable User Settings will determine what the screen looks like when you log in.

## Credit Manager User Type

When a manager logs in they see this overview screen, which provides a summary across all collectors with drilldown capabilities into specific clients. The manager might be able to see the entire company or a select team of credit controllers, depending upon their Group Security setup.

## Credit Controller User Type

When a credit control user logs in they see the "My Collections" screen rather than the "Credit Control Manager Home" and only the manager has the dashboard tiles across the top.

These menus at the top are the same between A/R and Credit Control Modules:

The sections within this documention module will drill into each of the above menus with more detail.

## "Default A/R User" User Type

If your User Type in A/R User Settings is "Default A/R User" then you normally wouldn't be given access to the Credit Control Module at all. Your landing page would look like the Credit Control User Type, but if you aren't a credit controller, you wouldn't have accounts assigned to you and the entire page would be blank, so no point in even having the module as an option. Default A/R users should just be given the Accounts Receivable module.

The landing screen in the Accounts Receivable module is ready to search for and open specific customer accounts. Whether or not the Cash In / Cash Out summary is displayed will be dependent on the Group Security for that user.
