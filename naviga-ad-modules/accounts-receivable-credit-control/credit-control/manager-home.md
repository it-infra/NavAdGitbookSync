# Manager Home

When a user is setup in the security settings as a credit control manager, the user’s home page will have navigation icons which allows you to manage the other controllers and their client statuses.

Click the Credit Control menu icon from the main menu.

Upon entering the Credit Control Module, only the users with the User Type of Credit Manager will have the navigation icons at the top of the screen throughout the Credit Control Module. These navigation links are shortcuts to commonly used screens which can also be found under the Credit Control and Payments menus

If already in the module, click the menu Credit Control -> Manager Home to naviga back to this screen or click on the navigation icon "Credit Control Manager Home"

This will provide you a list of your controllers and the balance for each client. You can change this view to display by due date or by invoice date. You can filter by company as well. You can also expand the details of each controller by clicking the arrow corresponding to each controller. This will provide a view of each client and their individual invoices’ balances and contact and collection notes.

Which controllers are accessible to you in this list is dependent on your User Security settings. For larger organizations with separate contoller groups belonging to different managers, there might be rules setup to restrict access.

At the top of this section, you can choose to filter by the collection status of the clients

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and you will be able to view the summary of each controller by status and export this information to excel or pdf using the icons available.
