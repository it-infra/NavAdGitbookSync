# Credit Control Assignments

Click the navigation icon “Assign Controller to Clients” or Navigate to Credit Control -> Credit Contol Assignments and you will be redirected to this screen which allows you to assign specific controllers to specific clients.

## Change or Reassign Controller

This screen is the default node display when user clicks the menu icon on the banner “Assign Controller to Clients”.

If reassigning an account from one controller to another choose the current controller from the drop down. Other account selection options include: territory, client type, account type, or name spelling ranges. Next, click the button “Get Accounts”. The accounts corresponding to this search will display.

For each record you can change the individual assigned controller to another controller from the drop down menu and click “Save Changes”.

### Bulk Change Assignments

You can also do bulk changes by clicking the button “Bulk Change Assignments”.

This will open a pop-up screen to change the controller from the existing and to a new one. Click “Apply”. This will change all the clients assigned to one controller to be assigned to the new one.

Note that you can narrow down your search on this screen by typing in in the blank box under the column heading. For example, in the name column, type in the blank box a partial name of the client. This will automatically refresh the screen to display names with this partial text in them.

## Assign by Aging

Click the node on the left hand side “Assign by Aging”. This will allow you to assign different controllers to different clients depending on the aging of the invoice date or the due date on the payment.

You can then similarly perform an individual change of controller per item or do a bulk change for multiple invoices.
