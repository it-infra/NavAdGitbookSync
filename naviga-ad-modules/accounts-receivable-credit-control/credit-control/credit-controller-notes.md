## Credit Controller Note Import

Navigate to the menu Credit Control -> Import Credit Controller Notes. In the Name field, choose either:

* Name ID is the system’s Name ID: If the ID in the template is the system Name ID, the template will attach the notes to that same system’s Name ID.
* Use the Legacy ID to Derive the system Name ID: The ID is the legacy ID in the sheet and connects to a new or existing system’s ID.

Click the button “Download Template” and an excel sheet displays on your desktop. Fill out the column values according to the section below titled Template. Save the data to your desktop and then click the “Select” button on the import screen. Browse for the file to upload to the system. Click the “Test Import File” button and the system alerts you to any errors in the spreadsheet.

If there are errors, remove the sheet from the screen by clicking the x red button. Resave the file and retest the import. Repeat until you get a successful test.

Click the button “Import File” and this uploads the template and vendor IDs into the system. You can view the new vendors when you search for them in the client overview screen.
