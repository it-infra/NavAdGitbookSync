## My Collections Accounts <a href="#_toc455046298" id="_toc455046298"></a>

The contoller home page is really the central hub for users making collection calls. It allows the user to easily see who needs to be called, what the last note was, when the last payemnt was received, etc.

In the controller home page, you can select and send along invoices as email attachments from this screen. You can only have one client line expanded at a time. The option is in the options/actions call out menu.

At the top, create a next contact date and select the contact person, also select the updated status for this customer (if applicable). Enter desired notes, flag "Notify Rep(s)" to alert the reps in the CRM Alerts panel about the note. At the bottom, select one or more invoices that you had discussed with the customer.
