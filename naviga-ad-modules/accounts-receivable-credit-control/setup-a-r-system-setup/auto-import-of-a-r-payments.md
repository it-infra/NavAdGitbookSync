# Auto Import of A/R Payments

The purpose of this document is to explain how users can setup and utilize the feature of automatically importing A/R payments into Naviga.

### Pre-requisite <a href="#_toc79080700" id="_toc79080700"></a>

Automatic import of A/R payments feature must be setup with the appropriate paths to deposit the necessary information and alert the admin for any errors. Naviga programmers will setup the user’s correct windows services and determine the how often it polls for data.

Naviga programmers will setup the paths on the repository for each account user has such as Live, Test and any others.

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Auto Import of A/R Payments -> Auto Import of A/R Payments Setup.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (6)>)

Set the enable auto import of A/R payments to “yes”. Enter the email address to notify when the auto import process completes successfully or with errors.

“Email when Auto-Import is Completed” field contains the email address of the recipient(s). An email is sent to this recipient every time a run is processed to indicate the status of the run. If an error is found on any line, the whole batch file is rejected.

You must enter the import path which is the location of the imported files on your server so that Naviga knows the location from which to retrieve the import files.

You also must enter the error messages path so that error messages are saved in that location when there is a problem with the import process. The log path is where the system saves the log of the import process for audit purposes.

Click the “Save” button to store this data.

### Process Overview <a href="#_toc79080701" id="_toc79080701"></a>

There are two ways to build the files:

1. All transactions in 1 file. This gives user one email per batch. The advantage of this approach is that there is only one email to review since all items are in one batch. On the other hand, if one item fails, the whole batch is rejected.
2. Create a new file for each check, where this file may contain multiple lines for each invoice the check is paying. The advantage of this process is if a line has an error, only this check is rejected. On the other hand, user receives multiple emails generated by the system and spends more time managing them.

The process is customized to meet each client’s needs. For example:

1. Period date: If user cannot provide it, then Naviga system determines how to create it.
2. Bank: If user cannot provide it, then Naviga system determines how to create it.
3. Client ID: If user cannot provide it, then Naviga system retrieves it from the invoice, making the invoice mandatory and user cannot enter COA.
4. Invoice Number: If not provided, then Naviga Ad determines if the process is rejected or create COA.

### Auto A/R Payment Import <a href="#_toc79080702" id="_toc79080702"></a>

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Auto Import of A/R Payments -> Auto Import of A/R Payments Queue.

This menu is to monitor the auto payments import process. User cannot edit any of the data in this screen.

Note that the process will display “Active” status since you enabled the process. Then you can view different panes for the queue of imported payments and view the file. You can also view the errors and log queue, so that you can monitor the process.

All these panes data are available to be exported to excel and PDF using the respective icons for each pane.
