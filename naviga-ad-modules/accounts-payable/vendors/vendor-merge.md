# Vendor Merge

The vendor merge/purge operation combines one or more vendor accounts into an existing vendor account. The process cannot be undone and will combine all merged accounts’ data into the destination account.

The AP Vendor merge process will merge invoices and checks under the target vendor while deleting the source vendor(s). The system accounts for identical invoice ids by adding a .1 to make the ID unique.

Navigate to the menu Vendors -> Vendor Merge.

Select the target vendor to merge all under in the field “Vendor to Merge to”. This will be the vendor that the system will keep after the merge process is completed. Then choose the vendor to be merged in the section “Vendors to Merge”. Click the + to add the vendor. This vendor will be deleted after the data is merged into the above vendor.

Repeat to add more vendors and click the + to merge more vendors into the one vendor. Then click “Merge Vendors”.

Click the Merge/ Purge Vendor History node.

Search by date range and/or user who did the merge or vendor IDs. Click “Get Data” and the merged vendors display.
