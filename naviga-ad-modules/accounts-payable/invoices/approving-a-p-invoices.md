# Approving A/P Invoices

Two menu items "Approve Invoices for Posting" and "Approve Invoices for Payment" will display a list of invoices requiring the logged in user's approval for Posting, or for Payment.

## Approve Invoices for Posting

On a [vendor account](../vendors/vendor-maintenance.md#payment-settings), there is a setting (in Payment Settings) indicating whether or not that vendor's Invoices need to be approved prior to POSTING.

User can only see Invoices that they are responsible for approving on this list. For all pending approval invoices, see **Invoices -> A/P Invoice Entry -> List of Invoices Pending Approval.** That list will also display who the invoice is awaiting approval from.

In Approve Invoices for Posting, select approval status for each invoice. Options include Pending, Approved, Disapproved. If Disapproved is selected, the Disapproval reason field becomes editable so the approver can add a comment on why they are disapproving. User can also click the invoice ID to view the A/P Invoice Detail screen.

## Approve Invoices for Payment

On A/P System Setup ([**Setup -> Admin -> A/P system Setup**](../setup/admin/a-p-system-setup.md#payment-approvals)) there is a flag to indicate if PAYMENT approvals are enabled and who should be approving payments.

When the approving user is logged in, the invoices awaiting payment approval are displayed:

Once the invoices requiring approval for payment have been approved, they will appear on the screen **Payments -> Pay A/P Invoices -> Generate Checks**
