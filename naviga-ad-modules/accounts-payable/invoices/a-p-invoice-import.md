# A/P Invoice Import

## Importing Invoices

User can import in multiple invoices using a template. Navigate to the menu Invoices -> A/P Invoice Import. Download and open the provided template by clicking "Download Template" button.

Note that in the template, columns in bold are mandatory, and if highlighted in yellow, the values have to match the Naviga value. Invoices with multiple G/L Allocation or Payment lines are entered as separate lines with the same Invoice ID and Vendor ID. The first occurrence of an Invoice ID / Vendor ID combination must include the invoice detail, subsequent lines need only contain Invoice ID, Vendor ID and G/L and payment information.

The option “Use Legacy Vendor ID” if checked to “Yes”, will allow the import process to match the Vendor ID in the spreadsheet to a legacy ID on a vendor rather than the Naviga Vendor ID. If checked as “No”, the system will use the Naviga vendor ID.

You can check the button “Invoices are Historical”: If set to "No" then invoices are written into an A/P Batch and will need to be posted to the A/P. If set to "Yes" then the invoices are posted straight to the A/P.

If the Invoices are Historical flag is set to yes, you can also optionally click the button “Flag Invoices as Posted to G/L”. This will mark the imported invoices as posted already to the G/L and it will not post again. If set to no, the invoices will be posted to the G/L from Naviga.

Download the template from this screen which opens a spreadsheet. Fill out the sheet and save to your desktop. For the template details, please see section below titled Template Fields.

Then click the “Select” button to choose the spreadsheet and upload to Naviga. To flush out any errors on the spreadsheet, click the button “Test Import” and click OK if you get an error because the system will display the line and cause of error.

After error corrections, resave the template to your desktop. Then click the x remove button to clear the upload then re-click the select button to upload the corrected sheet. Then click the “Import File” to complete the import file. The system will provide an ID for the import.

To view the imported invoices, user can click the node “List of Imported Invoices” and pull up the import ID, and view all imported invoices.
