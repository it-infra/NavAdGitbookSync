# Remit to Ad Agency Unposted Payments List

This is a report which displays the agency commissions due. Normally, in advertising, user bills the ad agency at net value (the order displays gross, agency commission and net) and the agency bills their customer at gross, with the difference being their commission.

A direct remit is often used when the agency is not paying their bills and you do not want to lose the advertiser, so you set up the advertising customer as direct remit. You bill the agency at gross and then the accounts payable system gives you a report. When the customer pays you, you cut a check and send the agency their commission check. The Remit to flag is set on the Brand. Make sure to have a Refund Vendor linked to the Agency's A/R settings in Advertising Module Advertiser / Agency Maintenance screen.

Note that the report displays any remits for which you have received payment from the advertiser and have not yet paid the agency. If advertiser has not paid, the data will not display, and if you have paid the agency the relevant data will not be there.

The report uses these parameters to generate the data:

1. Who is a direct remit;
2. Which advertisers have paid;
3. Which agencies have not yet been paid.

The report is found under the accounts payable menu Invoices -> Remit to Ad Agency Unposted Payments List. There is no search criteria for this report since it only shows pending / unposted payments.

Note that you can drag a column heading to the red bar where indicated to group the data by that column. You can also filter on the column by typing partial alphanumeric in the blank box underneath each column heading.

You can also export to Excel or PDF for further use of the data.
