# A/P Batch Entry / Review

Navigate to **Invoices -> A/P Batch Entry / Review** and enter a Batch number and press enter. User can also get to this screen by clicking on a Batch ID hyperlink from elsewhere, like the Post Batches screen in A/P invoice entry, or in the A/P Invoice Detail screen of an individual invoice.

This screen will list all invoices that were part of the batch. Click on the Vendor name to access the Vendor Overview screen or click on an invoice number to open the A/P Invoice detail screen.

If the batch has already been posted, everything on this screen will be read-only. If the batch has not yet been posted, this screen is where you will go to enter expected totals information (Invoice count and total amount of the invoice batch). Depending upon Group Security, the Expected totals may need to be equal to the Actual Totals before a user is permitted to close a batch.
