# Vendor User Defined Fields Setup

User Defined Fields allow you to add custom fields on Vendor Maintenance Screen when these fields arenâ€™t readily available as part of Naviga Standard screens. These can be text, numeric, dropdowns, or multi-select lists. The basics of how to set up each type of UDF is the same as elsewhere in the system where it is possible to create your own User Defined fields. See [Opportunity User Defined fields](../../crm/setup/crm-system-settings.md#\_toc120632532) setup for more details around how to set up each type of UDF.
