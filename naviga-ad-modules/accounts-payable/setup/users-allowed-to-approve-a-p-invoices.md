# Users Allowed to Approve A/P Invoices

In Vendor Maintenance, there is a setting to require approvals for invoices created for certain Vendors. If that flag is set to yes, there is a field to set which system user should be prompted to approve the invoice. During Invoice entry, that user will be the default approver, but that can be changed during invoice entry. The list of users set up here will be the only users displayed in the dropdown list of available approvers.

To add approvers to this list, navigate to Setup -> Users allowed to Approve A/P Invoices.

The white dropdown box at the bottom of the screen displays system users. Select a system user and click the plus sign to add them to this list. Users in this list will be full system users as well as users that are licensed to only approve A/P invoices (see [User Administration](../../system-settings-admin/security/user-admin-security.md) for more on license types)
