# Recurring Invoice Groups

Recurring invoices, such as monthly lease payments, can be categorized into groups for reporting purposes.

To setup Recurring Invoice Groups, navigate to Setup -> Recurring Invoice Groups.

Enter a group ID and a Description at the bottom and then click the + to add that group to the list.

Click save at the bottom once you have added all desired groups.

Once a group is in use, it can no longer be deleted (X on the row will be gray when in use and red when not in use). If you no longer with to use a group that cannot be deleted, it can be marked as inactive. Save any changes.

When setting up Recurring Invoices (In Invoices -> A/P Invoice Entry), you can assign them to a group, and then when running the recurring invoice process, they can be filtered by the Group, to easily process in smaller batches.
