3. Prevent invoice amount to exceed P.O. line amounts: If checked, this option will not allow users to enter invoice amounts in excess of the purchase order line items amounts. The below screenshot is from AP Invoice Entry. The below is $700. If this is set to "yes", and if the below PO was for $700, even if I typed $800 in the amount field, it would revert to $700. It will allow me to enter an amount less than 700, but not more than 700.\
