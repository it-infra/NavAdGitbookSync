# Vendor Type Setup

The vendor type is the classification of the vendor if you would like to group vendors together for later reporting purposes. For example, a type can be “Monthly Utilities”, and another can be “Miscellaneous” which is a onetime vendor, such as a delivery service. It is recommended to limit the use of the “Miscellaneous” one time vendors for better reporting.

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Vendor Type Setup. Enter a vendor type ID, and description. Click the save button to store the settings.
