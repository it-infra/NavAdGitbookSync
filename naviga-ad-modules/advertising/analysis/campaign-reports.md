The system loads in daily data from Google for Ad Server numbers. This allows users on the Period Report and the Pacing Report to set an “Served Data as of Date” to view the data. Enter the date to view the data based on served as of this date.

## Product Group Analysis <a href="#_toc121381182" id="_toc121381182"></a>

In the Executive Dashboard, click on the Product / Group Analysis Tile. This report provides a more in-depth analysis of the campaigns by product group or by product.

As a prerequisite, user should create groups of different products, such as a group for websites, another for e-newsletters, and so forth, or a group which includes different websites and e-newsletters for a specific industry. This is an organizational decision for the user to make.

This report provides the net revenue for each month starting the month which user chose in the drop-down criteria. Each month will have listed the number of orders per status, the budget, budget vs. confirmed orders, last year’s figures and confirmed numbers of this month versus that of last year. Similarly, there are other tabs which provide summary of orders for each advertiser, agency and PIB/industry displaying the total orders confirmed, total reserved and last year’s figures.

In the menu system, Navigate to Analysis -> Campaign Reports -> Product Group Analysis. This provides a slightly different report to the one above with the same name.

#### Data Difference in Reports <a href="#_toc121381187" id="_toc121381187"></a>

Note that if user compares the amount in the orders by product to the same column amount on the 12 Period Advertisers by Product Report, there may be a difference. One report produces the amount by date and the other by period, but running for every day in the period, user expects to see the same number in both reports.

The Orders by Product Report has many columns (estimates, actuals etc.), while the 12 Period one has one number for each month.

The difference between the two amounts is that on the orders by product report, user is looking at actuals. On the 12 Period report:

* If there are actuals, the report ignores the estimate and uses actuals (even if they are different)
* If there are no actuals, the report uses the estimate instead. This way, user can report into the future and can report in the past on campaigns where user may not yet have finalized the actuals).

Users may have many reports in the past that have zero actuals and had estimates.

The report uses the estimate, so that a past month report is the total of estimates and actuals, whereas the other report reflects just actuals. This is because users may have campaigns in the past that they have not yet reconciled.

Also, if you click on the rep name in the results, the campaign brand rep’s data is what displays, while the line rep data displays when you click on the amount in the period-month column.
