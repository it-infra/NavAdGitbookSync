# Informer Dashboards

This report is designed to embed certain Informer dashboards right into Naviga Ad so that end users can stay right within the Naviga Ad system and see their reports.

To be familiar terminology to former Adbase clients, we have called these Informer Widgets as they are custom reports that can be displayed in Naviga Ad in a similar way to sites created SalesLink widgets to display within SalesLink.

To set up a report to display in this window, go to the configuration tab and add a report name and an External link which you will get from the report in Informer.
