# Marketing Campaign 12 Period Analysis

### Marketing Campaign Analysis <a href="#_toc121381211" id="_toc121381211"></a>

The menu is under the Analysis menu. This reports provides details of all sales based on a search of marketing campaigns tied to a campaign. The marketing campaigns created in the CRM module when connected to campaigns can provide useful information of how effective marketing is for sales.

See also[ Product Group Analysis](campaign-reports.md#\_toc121381182). This report is almost identical except the filter at the top is for a marketing campaign rather than for a Product Group.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note - the term "Marketing Campaign" is a default, and can be overwritten with other terminology if you refer to them differently. At least one of our clients call it a "Project" rather than a "Marketing Campaign." That can be configured with the CRM System Settings under the Setup Menu
