## Production Calendar for Date-Based Products

Navigate to this report from Production -> Production Calendar for Date-Based Products

This screen provides a display of production calendar and orders for a date-based product such as e-newsletters by various filters such as date range, product or product group and controller name.

This can be viewed as an Inventory type report to visualize what spots can still be sold and can also be utilized as a production report to track what materials have been received vs what still needs to be worked on. This can be viewed for a single product or for multiple products.
