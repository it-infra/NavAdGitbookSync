# Bulk Change Ratecard

Navigate to Campaigns -> Bulk Change Ratecards

This was added so that the ratecard used for an advertiser and a product can be changed from one ratecard to another rate card. It could be that the customer was given the open rate while negotiating with the rep, but then a customer-specific ratecard was created and all their campaigns needed to be updated with a new ratecard. Or there could be other reasons why you need to move a client from one rate to another. When there are multiple campaigns and multiple order lines involved, this could save time.
