# Change Issue Date/Period

Sometimes the issue date of a product needs to be changed from one future date to another. This describes the steps required to easily change a date of an issue in Naviga Ad. This procedure will not only change the date on the campaign lines, but also change the issue configuration in product setup.

### Change Issue Date <a href="#_toc67561601" id="_toc67561601"></a>

Navigate to Campaigns -> Change Issue Date / Period. Select the Product and Issue Date to change to get a list of all the lines to be updated.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: take note of the Campaign End Dates in your list. They must be extended in advance of running this process if the new issue date falls after the current end date on any of the selected lines. You will only be able to select a new issue date sooner than the earliest end date of the campaigns
{% endhint %}

Select the new Issue date using the calendar or type in the date. The system will show an error if the date is after the earliest campaign end date. Also note the calendar will allow selection of dates up to earliest campaign end date. In this example September 1, 2021.
