# Campaigns

The campaign menu in Naviga Ad contains a lot of functions and reports - it is a bit of a monster! I will try and take you through it logically and will group it into manageable pieces. Admins can and should manage Menu Security for user groups so they only see what they need to on these menus so that it doesn't overwhelm them.

The documentation for Campaigns is broken up into multiple sub-groups as follows. Click below to jump to a topic, or use the left hand navigation to select a Documentation Section
