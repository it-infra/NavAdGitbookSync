## Advertiser / Agency Inquiry

In the Ad module, navigate to Customers -> Advertiser / Agency Inquiry

This will take you to a seach screen to find an existing customer account. Search by Name at the top, or on the advanced search tab you can search by Name and many other fields. Can also search by a credit card (last 4-digits and card type) on the Search by Card Transaction tab.

Once search results are displayed click on the customer name or ID to open the Account Summary screen. Use the "History" tab to quickly select a recently accessed account (last 50 accounts displayed)

{% hint style="info" %}
At the very bottom of the customer menu, you will find your 10 most recently accessed accounts. This is another quick way to get to the Customer Account View screen.
{% endhint %}

## Customer Account view

The customer account record will be displayed and will default to the "Sales CRM" tab.

User can click the different tabs at the top - AR, Production or Exhibition tabs to view and act regarding the account displayed on the screen. See Also [Accounts Receivable > Customers](../../accounts-receivable-credit-control/customers-a-r/#\_toc124065030). User can also change customer accounts by entering a different account name or ID in the Account Quick Search field. Click the magnifying glass icon to do a more advanced search or the hierarchy icon to see the hierarchy of the account (parent/child/brands/contacts)

The top section includes three sections:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1104).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Account overview details
2. Map / Address / My Contacts for quick access to my contact people (additional contacts may be shown further down the page as well
3. Revenue and Insights - There are 4 tabs with various sales summaries over time. Sales by year, sales by product, sales by format and sales by brand. Insights shows how this customer compares to other accounts in your database who have the same industry. It is meant to give sales reps ideas of other products to pitch based on where similar advertisers are advertising. We also offer an integration with MediaRadar, but this Insights section is just looking at your own data.

The light blue bar at the bottom of this section has several function buttons

1. Edit this Account - click to view and edit Name and Address Information, including Tax ID and Registered Company Number, Social media inks, Sources and Aliases. Depending on permissions, you may or may not also be able to access the full Advertiser/Agency Maintenance screen from within this window. Also depending on permissions, you may or may not be able to Edit the Name and address information in this window.
2. Add to Favorites / Add to My Customers - This adds this account to your "My Customers" list and/or marks them with a \* to pin them to the top of the list. It does **not** mean that you are getting commission credit for this account - that is handled in Brand Maintenance.
3. Link a contact - This will allow you to link a contact from one account to a different account. For example, if you are working with the BMW account, you might actually be dealing with an Agency representative rather than the actual client. You would create the contact under their employer (the agency) but link it to the BMW account, so when you are looking at the client, you know who to talk to related to that client.
4. New Contact - Create a new contact person for the account, including address, phone, email, social media links and contact preferences
5. New Note - Create a new note for the account. This can be linked to a contact person, a product or exhibition, or a marketing campaign. There is an HTML text editor in the note, so that you can bold, highlight, copy images, etc into your notes.
6. New To-Do - Creates a new task or meeting record. This task may or may not sync to your Gmail/Outlook calendar depending on if you are using our Nylas email Integration.

The next section shows Interests, Recent Activities/Attachments and Quick Links

1. Interests is a section where a rep can tag a client as being interested in Categories, Products or Exhibitions. These tags can then be use in "My Lists" to pull out lists of clients for marketing purposes.
2. Recent Activity is looking at the last 30 days of account activity and showing what has been going on. This includes things like new Opportunities, new proposals / orders, new Tasks, Invoices generated, payments received, customer activity in the Portal
3. Quick Links has some hard coded links as well as custom links that you can setup. The ones displayed below are the hard coded links. Scroll down to see any that you have set up. Setup for Custom Links is in CRM -> CRM System Settings -> CRM Global Parameters. There are several Invenory Checking links in this window. See [Inventory Checking](../campaigns/inventory-checking.md) for more information

The remainder of the screen features various sections that have shutter contols in the top right. Click the shutter to open/close the section. Click and drag the dark blue section header to reorder the sections to put these objects in your own desired order.

The system will remember how you last viewed these sections and display them in that order the next time you open an account.
