# Brand Reports

Navigate to Customers -> Brands -> Brand Assignment...

There are 3 reports related to Brand Assignment. These reports aren't for changing the reps, but rather a display to show which brands are assigned to whom.

## Brand Assignment by Rep

Select a sales person and an "as of" date at the top. Grid displays Advertiser, brand, the type of assignment, and when their last campaign ends and if it is a split account between more than one rep. This list can be exported to Excel or PDF format.
