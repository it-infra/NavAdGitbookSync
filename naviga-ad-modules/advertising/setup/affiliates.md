# Affiliates

The purpose of this document is to explain the process of revenue split with your publishing affiliate.

### Contract Publishing <a href="#_toc78296828" id="_toc78296828"></a>

Contract Publishing is a custom publishing feature where you as a publisher are in a contract publishing agreement with an affiliate to publish a product such as a print, digital or exhibition product. This affiliation agreement allows you to share in the advertising revenue with the affiliate. Naviga allows you to keep track of the affiliates’ share of revenues on these orders placed in these products.

### Affiliate Setup <a href="#_toc78296829" id="_toc78296829"></a>

To setup the affiliate, navigate to the menu Setup -> Affiliate Setup or the menu Analysis -> Affiliates -> Affiliate Setup.\\

### Product Affiliate Setup <a href="#_toc78296831" id="_toc78296831"></a>

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Product Setup, and choose the product from the drop down menu. This is the product you are publishing as a contract publishing with the affiliate.

This will provide you with all the commissions allotted to the affiliate, including the order details and the affiliate share and commission amount. You can now check the “Processed” box corresponding to the order and click on “Save”, which will process the commission for the affiliate, much like the sales rep commissions processing.

Once you process the affiliate commission it will display if you change the option to “All Commission Processed in this Period”.
