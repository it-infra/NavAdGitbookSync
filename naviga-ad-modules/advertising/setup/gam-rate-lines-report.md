# GAM Rate Lines Report

The GAM ratelines report gives you a visual of all the GAM rates in the system and the targeting that is set up for each rateline. GAM rates can be really complex, so It's really helpful during setup to be able to see the ratelines that you have completed and what targeting has been set for each.

At the top of the screen select desired filters to show desired rates. Can filter by Product(s), by Product Group(s), and/or by Expiration date range.

Click on the configure output tab to select/deselect the desired columns for both on-screen viewing and also for export to Excel.
