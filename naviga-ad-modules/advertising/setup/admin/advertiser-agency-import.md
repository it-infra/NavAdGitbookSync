# Advertiser Agency Import

## Import Names

User can import any number of companies or individuals in the same sheet into the advertising system to be used like any other advertiser or agency created from within the application.

To do so, navigate to the advertising module menu Setup -> Admin -> Advertiser/ Agency Import.

Duplicate Option field allows you to choose one of the following:

* Allow for Duplicate Name and Address: If you choose this option, the system allows you to import a client name and address which already exists resulting in double the account name and address in the system.
* Do Not Allow for Duplicate Name and Address: If you choose this option, the system prevents you from importing accounts which have the same name and address in the system. The import will not take place.
* Dedupe Name and Address and Append Legacy ID: If you choose this option, the system checks first for duplicates and imports if the following conditions are not satisfied:
  * Name: First 6 characters of the account name in the application match the name in the import sheet; and
  * Address: First 5 characters of line 1 of the account address in the application match the name in the import sheet; and
  * Zip Code: First 5 characters of the account zip code in the application match the ones in the import sheet.

If these conditions are not met, the system checks for the following conditions to verify if the sheet account is a duplicate of an account:

* Address: First 5 characters of line 1 in the address on the account in the application; and
* Zip Code: First 5 characters of account in the application; and
* Phone Number: The full phone number of the account in the application.

If none of the above sets of conditions are met, then the import will be successful, and the legacy ID is added to the account when imported. The system would append all the deduped records legacy ID, so they could be used for order imports later. It will also add the company name to the Alias field on the advertiser record created so that the user can see them in search screens.

Choose the option which suits your needs.

\*\*\* Industry Category / PIB Note - In Setup -> Admin -> System Parameters there is a setting "Set new advertisers to not use multiple brands" - if this is set to NO, meaning new advertisers WILL use multiple brands, this field on the import template will be ignored and the Industry / PIB should be set on the BRAND IMPORT.

If "Set new advertisers to not use multiple brands" is set to YES, meaning the clients will only use one brand, then that brand will be created and named for the advertiser during this import and the Industry Category set on this import template will be set on the brand. Industry code isn't required on the import but it is advisable to set it. If it isn't set, during order entry, the Industry code will default to whatever is top on the list of Industry codes, which might not be desirable.
