# Email Duplicates

In live implementations, we strongly recommend never creating duplicate contacts or allowing duplicate emails in the system and there are controls to prevent that from happening. There is functionality in the system to link the same contact to multiple accounts, and there is the capability to move a contact from one parent to another in the scenario when a user transfers jobs.

If the recommended rules are turned off. this report will assist in helping to locate when a duplicate email address exists in the system.
