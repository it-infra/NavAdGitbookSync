The 5 id's are hard coded, but you can change the description to anything you want. Subscriber, Non-Subscriber, Retail are commonly used, plus you have two others to work with if needed. Any Zone Dimensions you do not need should be marked as inactive so they don't display in order entry.

Return the [Zone Setup ](../product-setup/products/issue-based-setup/preprint-zones-zone-configration.md)screen in Product Setup and enter the details per day in each of these dimension layers. Save the details.
