Q1 - Q3 -> These are your quote statuses, which you can call whatever you wish. You can also assign a probablility % indicating how likely it is that you will close the deal. The Quote can be displayed at full value or at weighted value in some CRM reports.

R1 - R3 -> These are your reserved statuses. These generally indicate that the proposal has been approved by the client but that you have some internal checks to complete before the ad is ready to publish. Whether or not ads flow to GAM or to Plan are determined by status settings.

If you do not need all three quotes or all three reserved statuses, you can use the Group security setup to restrict the unused statuses from users.

Confirmed orders are ready to run and are ready to be billed.

Invoicing Started behaves similarly to Confirmed. It is still considered to be a confirmed order for reporting purposes, but it is an indicator that the campaign has started billing. (a single campaign may receive multiple invoices if it runs over multiple months..
