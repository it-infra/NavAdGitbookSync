# Column Layout Maintenance

This screen is used to define the column sizes for your print publications. A single column layout can be using in multiple publications which share the same mechanicals.

To Create a new Layout, click the "new" button and enter an ID and a Description to describe your layout.

Select the appropriate Unit of Measure. Options are Inches, CM or MM. There is also an "Undefined" option in there, but that is not recommended or we will not be able to calculate the actual size of the ad.

Set inactive to Yes if you no longer wish to use a layout.

Enter the maximum number of columns for this layout. In the above example, my 6 Column Broadsheet publication allows for spreads to be booked, so the Max columns was set up as 12. Note that the difference between the size of 6 & 7 Columns includes not only the normal gutter between the other columns, but also includes the inside margins for the spread.

Fractional columns are supported if you need them. Whole Columsn is the default, but half, quarter and tenth columns are allowed.

These Column sizes will be used in the [Page Equivalency calculations](ad-sizes.md#page-equivalency-for-print-ads) when booking Cost Per something type ads. (Cost Per Col Inch/mm/cm)
