# Incentives

The incentives program is available for offering user’s clients order discounts based on (1) Quantity, (2) Multi-product ads and (3) Insertion Frequency. Each program has its own qualifiers, discount rules and conditions as well as application to either the whole campaign or to individual line item within a campaign. Campaigns which don’t meet the incentive program will still display available achievable discounts to guide the order entry user to utilize them if the client desires to do so.

## Incentives Setup <a href="#_toc116940347" id="_toc116940347"></a>

To setup the incentives, navigate to the menu Setup -> Advertising setup -> Incentives Setup.

Each of the programs contains a section to choose its name, description and type.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1315).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another section for basic settings date range during which it’s valid, whether it can be combined with other incentive programs or not, whether to include lines that have a contract condition on them or not, and whether to apply to line items which are client specific Ratecard or not.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (957).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the dates of the incentive are entry dates and not necessarily campaign start and end dates. So setup the incentive start date to be the day before you’d like the entry user to be able to apply the incentives to campaigns.
{% endhint %}

Another section includes Notes. Both Internal notes and Sales Prompts are included here.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (910).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another section includes the qualifiers which are the conditions which the campaign must meet to qualify for the incentive. For example, the Product Group, the Client Type, the Advertiser, the Ad Types to include or exclude, the formats to include or exclude, and the Products to include or exclude. You can choose the Product Group and not choose any Products and the incentives will apply to all products in that group. You can also choose to have incentives available for only specific Sections or Classified Categories.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (290).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another section includes the discount rules of the up to amounts’ ranges and discount percentages to apply to Gross or Net. Note that if a campaign exceeds the maximum incentive allowed, the incentive package won’t be available and will be only achievable. So, every incentive level must be explicitly listed.

Once a campaign is deemed qualified for this incentive, the following section’s rules are used to determine which items will receive the incentive discounting. For example, include or exclude the AD Type, Format and Product to which the incentive discounts apply. For example, even if the qualification requires multiple products listed, this section can include only one product to which to apply the discount and not to the other products. The same applies to all conditions in this section such as the AD Type and Format of the product.

### Multi-Product Incentive <a href="#_toc116940348" id="_toc116940348"></a>

The idea of the Multi-Product Incentive is that you want to reward advertisers with better discounts when they purchase more of your products.

The first tab in this section applies incentives if the multiple product chosen here in this section are included in a campaign.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (101).png>)

Fill in the details as explained in the Setup section above to apply to these products and save the incentive. You can create multiple incentive programs for other multiple products together.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/2 (70).png>)

Apply the discount to the Net or Gross on the line.

The incentive discount rules contain the “From Qty”, “Up to Quantity” and Percent fields where you can enter the first line as From Qty to be from 0 to 2 products and the corresponding percent to be 5 to apply 5% when the campaign has the two products in the incentive deal.

Navigate to create lines with the products in this incentive package. Then once complete in the Line Item tab, click the button “Check Incentives”.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1169).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The pop-up screen displays the available incentives if any according to the rules set in the incentive package matching the campaign.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (47).png>)

Check the box for the incentive you’d like to apply to this campaign.

Note that the incentive package details display regarding the conditions as per the setup, including the “Next incentive Level Discount Percent”, meaning that if the campaign contains higher number of lines to match this next “Up to Quantity” field level, then the discount available is that percentage as per the setup of the incentive.

Click the expansion arrow to display the products on this campaign to which this incentive applies. If the campaign contains other lines to which is this incentive doesn’t apply, they won’t be listed.

Once you add more lines applicable to the incentive package rules, the higher percentage kicks in.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (16).png>)

Click the hyperlink “Click here to check a specific incentive”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (46).png>)

Choose the incentive from the “Incentive Check” drop-down and the details display. They include the Non Qualifying Details on your campaign explaining the campaign number, and the unqualifying conditions, such as the product or product group, and so forth.

Back on the Incentives list, click “Apply Selected Incentives”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/7 (48).png>)

The system calculates the discount based on the Gross/ Net as you’ve setup the package. The line items each display the adjustment.

When finished, click the “Applied Incentives” tab on the line item entry screen.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (37).png>)

The system displays a list of each line and its details including the discounts. Click the hyperlink to any line and it displays its details.

If the campaign doesn’t have enough lines to reach the incentive discount, click the “Check Incentives” tab on the line item entry screen.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (34).png>)

The “Selected & Available Incentives” tab is blank, because the campaign doesn’t have enough product lines to meet the rules of the incentive package. Then click “Achievable Incentives” tab. The system displays the first level achievable to use the incentive discount. You can then view the list of qualifiers and add more lines accordingly if the advertiser desires to do so.

### Volume Incentive <a href="#_toc116940349" id="_toc116940349"></a>

This incentive package applies the dollar amount of the campaign in order to apply a certain percentage. The idea here is that a better discount will be available to those who spend more money.

The setup procedure of Volume Incentives is exactly the same as the above Multi-Product Incentives, except that the Discount Rules section is looking at the dollars spent rather than the quantity of products purchased.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1470).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Enter a new campaign to not reach the conditions here at first, and then click “Check Incentives” -> “Achievable Incentives”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (21).png>)

Now you can see not only this package but also any other packages that are applicable to the campaign. These can be of different types of packages such as multi-product, volume or frequency based.

Add more lines to the campaign to fulfill the conditions in the Volume Incentive package. Then click “Check Incentives”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/11 (22).png>)

The system displays the lines applicable to have the discount even if the campaign has multiple lines which meet the basic requirements on the package. Note that the incentive quantity amount is listed which could be more than the applicable line. The screen also includes the next step qualifying amount in case your advertiser would like to add a line to reach this amount and apply a higher discount.

Check the box to apply the incentive discount and click “Apply Selected Incentives”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (6).png>)

Once complete, the lines display the discount percentage applied to the applicable line.

### Frequency Incentive <a href="#_toc85224674" id="_toc85224674"></a>

This incentive package is based on frequency of line items in an order. So, when a certain number of lines is reached in a campaign combined with any other condition in the package then the discount percentages can be applied. Similarly, to the above packages, the conditions must be met first and then the rules can be applied accordingly.

Create a campaign to not meet the frequency conditions of the incentives but using the products in the incentive package. Click “Check Incentives”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/13 (24).png>)

In the “Achievable Incentives” the system displays incentives which can be achieved if you fulfill the frequency range. The “Selected & Available Incentives” tab remains blank with none available.

Add lines to the campaign to fulfill the incentive requirements.

Then navigate back to the “Selected & Available Incentives” tab.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/14 (1).png>)

The system displays the available and qualifying incentive frequency package along with any other applicable ones which you may choose. You can now apply it.

For any of the above incentive packages, you can check the box for more than one available incentive and apply it.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/15 (12).png>)

Each package will be applied to the applicable lines according to the rules which you’ve setup prior.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/16 (14).png>)

You can view the details in the “Applied Incentives” tab in details.

Also, the amounts are reflected in detail per line under the Adjustments tab.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/17 (7).png>)

Each line details the Gross/ Net setup as well as the percent discount on the line.

#### Frequency Discount Day of the Week Filter <a href="#_toc116940351" id="_toc116940351"></a>

Incentive Setup based on frequency includes a filter on matching day of the week as a qualifier and where the incentive is applied. This only applies to line items where all issue dates match the selected day(s) of week set in the application.

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Advertising setup -> Incentive Setup -> Frequency Incentive.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/18 (2).png>)

Setup the frequency to be any number with the respective discount percentage. For example, frequency of 2 with a 5% discount and 3 with a 10% discount.

Scroll to the Qualifiers section and choose from the drop-down the day(s) of the week you’d like the frequency above to match. For example, the two issues must fall on these days of the week to meet the discount set. If the line item has two issues which both fall on this day, then the qualifying condition is met.

Scroll to the section of the Application Rules and in the field “Apply to Days of Week” select all days in the order on which the issues fall.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/19 (7).png>)

This field rule only applies to line items where all issue dates match the selected day(s) of week set here. Partial issues applying to the days will not allow this discount to apply to the order.

Save the incentive rule.

Navigate to the menu Campaigns -> Create New Campaign and enter line items to match the qualifying day(s) above and the number of issues to qualify for the frequency on those days.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/20 (1).png>)

If the frequency incentive package is for 3 issues to apply for the discount and the qualifier day is Friday, then the line items must be 3 issues all falling on a Friday. There can be more lines for issues on other days for example a Tuesday. Tuesday and Friday both must be the days chosen in the Incentive Setup above in the Application Rules” section.

Save the campaign. Then click the button “Check Incentives”.

Apply the incentive based on the setup above. If it doesn’t match, then the system displays it in the Achievable Incentives and instructs you on how to qualify for the deal.

#### Apply Base on Minimum or Maximum Count in Cycle/ Period <a href="#_toc116940352" id="_toc116940352"></a>

In the Discount Rules section, you can choose the Maximum or Minimum fields so that if you are using a start day and a cycle count, the system looks at all the ranges of dates and calculates the most insertions in the week or the fewest and then uses that number as the insertion discount level.

If this setup had a starting day for max days period of Sunday and max days of 7:

Suppose your insertion pattern looks like this:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="146"></th><th width="61"></th><th width="51"></th><th width="45"></th><th width="54"></th><th width="66"></th><th width="43"></th><th width="61"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Su</td><td>M</td><td>T</td><td>W</td><td>Th</td><td>F</td><td>Sa</td><td>Total Insertions</td></tr><tr><td>Week 1</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you have the field apply base set to Maximum, then every insertion above would get the 4 insertion level discount because everything gets the discount for the highest insertion could level of the campaign lines involved. If it were set to Minimum, then everything would get the 2 insertion level discount since that is the pattern with the lowest count.

#### Frequency Incentive on Base Rate Only for Liner Ads <a href="#_toc116940353" id="_toc116940353"></a>

Incentive package can be setup in case of the Liner ads to apply the frequency discount to apply to the base rate only and not to the overage rate.

Scroll to the Incentive Discount Rates section and check the flag “Apply to Line Base Rate Only”. Save the incentive package. Create a new campaign and create a line item using a Ratecard line which has overage amounts calculated and with 2 issues using this Ad Type in order to trigger eligibility for this incentive package. Click the “Check Incentives” button.

Apply the incentive to the line. Click the line item.

Note that the incentive adjustment percentage is applied to the Base Rate to produce the adjusted price per insertion.

If you uncheck the flag to “Apply to Base Rate Only” to set its value as “No” and create a new campaign using the exact lines as the campaign above, the Incentive discount is now applied to the Price Per Insertion which includes the Overage Rate calculated prior to the discount being applied.
