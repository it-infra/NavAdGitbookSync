Click “New” and enter a schedule ID, Description and choose the rounding option of no rounding, to nearest 5, 10 or 15. This option will round up the amounts accordingly for frequency orders. Enter the frequency number to indicate the number of times which the order would be posted and the corresponding discount from the base rate in a ratecard.

This frequency must match the frequency number on the contract for the discount to display on the order. If there is no matching Frequency from the contract, or if the order is for a non-print item, then the system uses the Volume Discount % from the contract maintenance.

Save the schedule by clicking the save button.

You can choose to click the flag “Apply to Base Rate Only” and when this flag is checked, in the case of Classified liner ads only such as Column Per Inch, the discount percentage is then applied to the Base Rate of the Ratecard.

If the flag is left unchecked, the discount percentage in this schedule is applied to the Price Per Insertion field to produce the Adjustment which then is subtracted from the Price Per Insertion value to produce the adjusted price per insertion.
