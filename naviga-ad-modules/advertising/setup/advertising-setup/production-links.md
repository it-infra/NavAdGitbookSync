# Production Links

Production links are assigned to Product/Group Ratecard lines which then default onto campaign line items. These links are visible in the confirmation template to provide clients with direct links to production information. This might be used to direct clients to your website to read production spec information rather than adding it to all of your confirmation/proposal templates. These can be set up manually or imported.

## Production Links

To create a new production link, enter an ID, a description and a URL. These will then be tied to a ratecard line.
