## Edition Splits and Demographic Targeting <a href="#_toc50736525" id="_toc50736525"></a>

Edition splits and demographic targeting are available to be used in print products. Edition splits and demographic targeting allow user to have the same priced ad with different materials in an edition which is sent to different regions and different demographics.

Navigate to the Setup menu -> Product Setup -> Product Details. Choose the product from the drop-down menu and scroll to the field “Split Editions”.

You can either create the edition splits by clicking the “Add New Group” button or use the provided template to import your data hierarchy.

Click the “Add New Group” and enter the Split ID, description, sort code and children fields.

Leave the parent as blank to apply the split to the root. Save when finished.

If you choose to instead import data, you have the option to export all data of splits in the system, edit them and add to them then import them, or import in a template from scratch.

Click the button “Download Template with Current Edition Splits”.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/6 (56).png>)

Save the template to your desktop and view the existing data in the system display.

Add more splits ID, description and parent ID as needed and save the file.

Click the button “Select” and choose to upload the saved template.

Click “Replace Current Edition Splits” if you’d like the imported data to replace the existing editions in the system. Leave as “No” if you don’t want to replace and only add new data to the splits. Click Import.

The system informs you of which IDs were omitted from import for being duplicates and how many groups were imported. You can correct the template and repeat the import.

### Demographics

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Product Setup -> Demographics. Choose the print product from the drop-down menu.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/9 (6).png>)

Enter the ID and Description for the demographic lines and save when finished.

You can also Import Data by clicking that button and download the existing data in the template, edit it and reload to replace the existing data or just add to it. Or you can import using a blank template from scratch.

Once these fields have been created and split editions enabled, navigate to create a campaign for this product.

In the line item, note the Use Edition Splits button which you can set to Yes to allow you to use the edition splits. You can also choose the target demographics you created from the drop-down menu.

The order’s materials are now shared in the edition which is split to be sent to different regions. Note that if you have a multiple issues order then all the materials on the order will be attached to each issue on that order.

The material maintenance screen contains a section for Edition Splits to enter more details regarding the editions as they concern this material.
