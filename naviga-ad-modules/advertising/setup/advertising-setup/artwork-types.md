# Artwork Types

### Artwork Types and Material Deadlines

There is a new concept in Naviga Ad to help manage different deadline times based on the type of material expected.  Navigate to **Setup -> Advertising Setup ->Artwork Types** and create one or more Artwork Types.

Add an ID and a Description in the blank boxes and then click the + to add to the list of Artwork Types.  Repeat for as many artwork types as is needed.  Click Save

These artwork types can now be used in Deadline management on [Product Setup](../product-setup/products/product-listing-details.md#material-lead-closing-settings) - for booking and Material deadlines.&#x20;
