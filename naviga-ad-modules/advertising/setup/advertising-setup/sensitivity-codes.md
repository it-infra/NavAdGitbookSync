# Sensitivity Codes

Sensitivity codes are meant to draw the attention of the user that an ad contains sensitive information. Common uses are for Marijuana ads, political ads, Alcohol ads, etc. Oftentimes care must be taken as to where these types of ads are placed on a page. There is some setup on the ad side and also in Naviga Plan. To use this functionality, you will need to be on a Naviga Plan Version 141218 (April 21, 2023) or newer.

Navigate to Setup -> Advertising Setup -> Sensitivity Codes and add desired codes.

Then Navigate to Customers -> Advertiser/Agency Maintenance and select an account who typically publishes sensitive content. There is a field in the Advertising Details section where you can select one or more Sensitivity Codes for the client.

If you then create a campaign for that client, the client's sensitivity code will be displayed on the campaign header and can be modified as needed at the campaign level. OR if they client doesn't have a default sensitivity code, it can still be manually added onto a sensitive campaign.

Additionally, when you then create a material record for that campaign, the sensitivity code will flow through onto the material.

In Naviga Plan, this will show up as a "Clash" if the paginations Option is set for "Sensitive" or "Both" under Clash setting.
