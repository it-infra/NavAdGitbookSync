# Engagement Codes

See also [Reconcile Engagements](../../campaigns/ad-server-syncing-reconciliation.md#reconcile-engagements)

These Social Media Engagement codes are assigned to a Product, and can then be used in Order Entry and in Actuals Reconcilation for these product types. These can be used for any metrics beyond the standard clicks and impressions - for example: Emails Sent, Unique Opens, Total Opens, Tweets, Retweets, Shares, Likes, Comments, etc.
