# Ad Serving Platforms

This is the advertising platform such as any social advertising media platform. This is tied in to the Ad Type for non-GAM ad servers and allows for reporting on which lines were serving on other servers. These are not required but can provide additional reporting

To create a new Ad Server, enter an ID and a description and click the + to add the Ad Server. Any you no longer wish to use can be marked as inactive. Click Save.

Note - you do NOT need to set up GAM in here if you are using the built in API Integration with Google Ad Manager
