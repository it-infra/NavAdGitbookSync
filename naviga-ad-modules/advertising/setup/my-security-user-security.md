# My Security / User Security

See [System Settings -> Security -> User Admin / Security](../../system-settings-admin/security/user-admin-security.md#\_toc79061550) section for details on User Security

In Previous versions there was a "My Security Settings" menu item under the Setup Tab

Clicking the person icon in the top left of the screen, in any module, will open a screen with some information and editing capability to some user settings:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1547).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (454).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1441).png>) ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (959).png>)

They can update things like their "From Name" on forms, their preferred default product group in campaign entry, their profile picture, etc.

This also allows them to authenticate their email if using the email integration through Nylas. The My Profile screen also shows the link status to give users insight into the status of their connection. In versions prior to 23.2, we only showed the connection was authorized if it was in a "running" status, but there could be other valid statuses that aren't yet at the running stage. The new Link Status gives additional insight.

Possible options here are: valid┃invalid┃downloading┃running┃partial┃invalid-credentials┃exception┃sync-error┃stopped┃initializing

The meanings of each status is described below (taken from the [Nylas website](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/developer-guide/manage-accounts/account-sync-status/#monitoring-sync-states-in-the-nylas-dashboard))

<table><thead><tr><th width="129">Sync state</th><th width="109">Simplified</th><th width="111">Detailed</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>valid</td><td>x</td><td></td><td>All emails for folders, contacts, and calendars are syncing reliably.</td></tr><tr><td>invalid</td><td>x</td><td></td><td>The account has an authorization issue and needs to be re-authenticated.</td></tr><tr><td>downloading</td><td>x</td><td></td><td>All folders are connected and the account is in the process of syncing all historical messages on the account. Depending on the size of the account and the speed of the connection between Nylas and the email server, this can take up to 24 hours or more to complete. During this time, the account is usable for sending messages and receiving new email messages.</td></tr><tr><td>running</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>All emails for folders, contacts, and calendars are syncing reliably.</td></tr><tr><td>partial</td><td></td><td>x</td><td><p>Partial states are typically temporary and may indicate issues with the mail server. Accounts in this state, however, are still running.</p><p>One or more folders in the account may not fully sync currently or not sync mail at all. Typically, accounts recover and return to a full-running state.</p><p>Some reasons an account may be in a partial state:</p><ul><li>It's a new account and hasn't finished its initial sync.</li><li>The account was recently reauthenticated.</li><li>The user deletes, changes, adds, or restricts folders.</li><li>Slow network connections.</li><li>Low bandwidth on the email server.</li><li>A backlog within the Nylas platform.</li><li>A large number of folders in the user's mailbox.</li><li>Syncing historical data</li><li>The user has external integrations that may be slowing down their email server.</li><li>The user’s email server has connection or network issues.</li><li>Microsoft accounts with numerous folders.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>invalid-credentials</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>You can only continue to use an account with the Nylas API as long as the &#x3C;ACCESS_TOKEN> is valid. Sometimes, this token is invalidated by the provider when connection settings are changed or by the end-user when their password is changed. When this happens, reauthenticate the account and generate a new &#x3C;ACCESS_TOKEN> for the account.</td></tr><tr><td>exception</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>This can occur if an upstream provider returns an error that Nylas's sync engine doesn't yet understand. Please contact Naviga Support for accounts in this state.</td></tr><tr><td>sync-error</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>An unexpected error was raised while syncing an account. Please contact Naviga Support for accounts in this state.</td></tr><tr><td>stopped</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>An account stops syncing if it repeatedly encounters the same error or is unable to access the email server. In cases where an account has stopped, you can try to restart it using the downgrade and upgrade endpoints. If the account continues to fall into a stopped sync state, please contact Naviga Support.</td></tr><tr><td>initializing</td><td></td><td>x</td><td>The account has been authenticated on the Nylas platform and is in the process of connecting to all the account's folders. Accounts that use email.send as the only scope will always be in an initializing state. Nylas uses folders to determine sync status. email.send doesn't fetch folders.</td></tr></tbody></table>
