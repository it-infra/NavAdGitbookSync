# Importing Sections and Positions

## Import Section <a href="#_toc117696626" id="_toc117696626"></a>

You can import sections to the product. The fields which are bold are mandatory while the yellow highlighted must be filled with values preset in Naviga. If you have already created (or imported) sections, you can use the import to overwrite/update what is already there.

Bold fields are mandatory while non bold aren’t. Yellow highlighted fields must contain values which match the value already setup in Naviga Ad.

## Import Position <a href="#_toc117696625" id="_toc117696625"></a>

Using the given template, you can import positions in bulk to the product whether it’s a print or digital product. Once you download the template and save the data in each field as needed, it is recommended to test the import before importing. The system will alert you to errors in template values so you can correct and then re-upload the corrected template.

Bold fields are mandatory while non bold aren’t. Yellow highlighted fields must contain values which match the value already setup in Naviga Ad.

If you are also entering Sections for these positions, be sure to do that Import first. If you have already created (or imported) positions, you can use the import to overwrite/update what is already there
