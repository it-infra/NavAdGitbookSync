# Event-Based Setup

## Event Billing Schedules

This is not where you would set up billing schedules for actual Exhibition module events. That is done in the Exhibition module.

Some of our clients who host smaller events will set up their event products in the Advertising Module as Print Products with the issue date being the date of the event. If that is how you configured your event, this is where you can come to enter the default billing schedule for your flexible campaign.

Enter the desired billing dates in the Billing Date Column. Enter a comment if desired and enter the % to be billed on that date.
