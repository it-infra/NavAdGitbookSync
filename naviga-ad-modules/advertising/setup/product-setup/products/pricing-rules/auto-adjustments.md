# Auto Adjustments

Auto Price Adjustments feature available for a product’s Ratecard. Auto Adjustments are used to automatically insert one or more adjustments on a line when a Specific Ratecard and Rateline are selected. Auto adjustments will follow rules for the Ad Type, Currency and other limitations set on the Adjustment code. For example, if an auto adjustment only applies to Flat Fee Ad Types in USD currency, this auto adjustment will not be inserted if those additional requirements aren’t fulfilled in the campaign entry screen.

Note that as a pre-requisite, you must have Adjustments setup for the Ratecard line in the menu Setup -> Product Setup -> [Adjustments](price-adjustments.md).

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Product Setup -> Auto Adjustment OR if setting up on Product Groups, navigate to Product Group Setup -> Auto Adjustments.

Choose the Product from the Product ID drop-down menu (or Product Group if a Group Adjustment). Choose the Ratecard and Ratecard Line for which to apply an auto adjustment. Click the drop-down “Add Adjustments”, and you’ll see the list of adjustments available from the Adjustments tab. Note that only adjustments that do not have a prompt for value or prompt for qty selected will be eligible to be used as an automatic adjustment.

Click the + sign and if desired, check the box “Allow Delete”. This flag will then allow you to delete the adjustments in the order entry if desired. Save the settings.

When adding an Auto Adjustment to a Ratecard line, after saving the system prompts you if you’d like to apply this adjustment to the remaining ratecard lines.

A pop-up screen allows you to choose the some or all lines. Check which ones to apply this auto adjustment to and click copy. Sometimes ratecards have many many ratelines on them and this saves considerable time in setting up. It will replace any other auto adjustments that are already there.
