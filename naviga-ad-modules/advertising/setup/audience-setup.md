# Audience Setup

The audience field is an optional setting that can be used for controlling inventory on e-newsletters. The intent of the field is to allow for control of how many different emails are sent to any one audience. If you choose to implement this feature, you can require selection of an audience when entering an order for any e-newsletter. Based on setup in this table the system will prevent sending newsletters to any one audience more often than desired. By entering a default audience size you can default in suggested quantities for CPM orders. These default quantities can be adjusted at the product level and can be overwritten in campaign entry. These numbers do need to be manually maintained in Naviga Ad, separately from your circulation system.

After you setup these audience types in the Setup menu, these values appear in Product Setup. You can then enter a total number of audience for the product as well as individual audiences. Audiences are displayed in line items when entering e-newsletters where they can be defined as recipients of the Ad.

To add a new audience, enter an ID, Description, Size, and push frequency limit and click the + to add it. Click Save.

On the Audience Setup you can set the Frequency limits for how often you will send push notifications to this group of clients.

Note: Naviga Ad doesn't actually send out the e-newsletters, but this setting can restrict how many eNewsletters can be pushed to a given Audience and will prevent overbooking of free-format date eNewsletters. (Not relevant in scheduled newsletters that go out on a specific date and time, but will be relevant on custom date-time newsletters.
