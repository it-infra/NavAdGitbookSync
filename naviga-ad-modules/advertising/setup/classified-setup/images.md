Create organization for your Catalog by creating sub-folders for the images. For instance, you likely have different attention getter images for Real Estate category than you would have for a Pet ad.

The images in the Clients folder are ones you can upload into the system for each advertiser. You can create a new folder for each advertiser using the icons on top and upload these images. Images can be in the formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png. When using Images in Order entry, the system will automatically create folders for each client ID under the clients folder. you would only use the Clients folder in this setup screen if you need to manage the images later.
