## Budget Exchange Rate <a href="#_toc9435319" id="_toc9435319"></a>

In the currency setup screen under the advertising module menu Setup -> Systems Table Setup Currency Setup, the system allows for entering a budget exchange rate as well as tracking of this rateâ€™s history.

When user enters this rate against a certain currency, user will be allowed later to track all reports allowing for currency tracking in a budget exchange rate (either this year, last year or next year's budget exchange rate).

There is also a Group Security setting in which user can choose the options by which to view the tracking.

Navigate to the menu Setup -> Admin -> Group Security -> [Advertising Security.](../admin/group-security-ad.md#other-settings)

Scroll to the Currency Tracking Display Options section and choose whether to display all tracking currency options including current exchange rate, exchange rate from budget only or not display the tracking currency options at all and display only the local currency.
