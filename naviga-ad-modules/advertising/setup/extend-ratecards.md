# Extend Ratecards

It isn't always desireable to change the rates every year, so there is a process to extend existing ratecards rather than creating new ones.

Navigate to Setup -> Extend Ratecards in the Advertising Module

All three filter fields are optional, although you _**should**_ select something there to narrow down the results. Selecting all rate cards for all products would generally return too many results to be useful.

For example, you might want to find all ratecards for a given product group that are ending before the end of this month.

One you have your list of ratecards, click the bulk update to enter a new end date for the entire list.

Alternatively, enter dates manually in the New End Date Column and then save at the bottom of the list.
