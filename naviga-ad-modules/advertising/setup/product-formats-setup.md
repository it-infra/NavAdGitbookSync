# Product Formats Setup

Navigate to the Ad moduleâ€™s menu Setup and enter a format for each of your publishing media, such as publication, magazine, e-newsletter or website and so forth. Every product that you create in the system will be required to have a format. This can be as simple as print vs digital or it could be more detailed.

To create a new format, enter an ID and a Description and click the + to add to the list. Click Save. The Invoice line group can be set on the format, (an override can be set on products that deviate from the Line Group set on the format). This provides grouping options on Invoice Templates. See [Advertising Invoice Forms](advertising-setup/advertising-invoice-forms-templates-line-groups.md#invoice-line-groups) for more details on adding line groups to the Invoice template.

Formats are used in the CRM Sales Activity report and sales rep budgets can be set by product and/or by format. So if your reps have a print budget and a digital budget, you might want to keep it more simple for that use.

The Product Group Analysis report also has an option to view Sales by format.
