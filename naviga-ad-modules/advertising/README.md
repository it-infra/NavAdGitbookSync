The advertising module will be the primary module for booking ads and managing the material collection process. How you view the home screen will be dependent on your security. The large tiles at the top and the net confirmed orders section will typically only be displayed for managers. For general users, the Customer Search will be at the top, followed by the list of recent accounts and campaigns. Reports that you have been given access to will be on the right side where users can mark certain reports as their favorite to keep it pinned to the top of the list.
