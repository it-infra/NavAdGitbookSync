Download the template and fill in the excel sheet as described in the template section below. Note that User Import will import all names in the spreadsheet import template. Once the license count has been reached any additional names will be imported as Inactive.

Save the template to your desktop. Then click the “Browse” and select the template to upload. Click Test Import and the system provides you a list of errors in the import file.

Click the x Remove to remove the template. Then fix the errors in the template and re-save it to your desktop. Then repeat the browse and test import until you get a successful message.

Click Import File.

The system provides you with a success message. You can then lookup the users in the menu Security -> User Security.

Use the values and descriptions below to enter the correct values in your template. You can enter multiple lines to import multiple users. There’s no limit on the number of users you can import in one file.
