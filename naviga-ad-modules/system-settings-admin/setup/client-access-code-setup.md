To manually create access codes, enter an ID and a Description and click the + to add to the list. Repeat for each needed Access Code. If the access codes are the same as the companies in your system or the Product Groups in your system, use the short cut buttons at the top to load all companies or Product Groups as Access Codes.

Click Save to save the codes.
