# Activity

## Active Sessions

This will list all users currently logged into the system.

It isn't needed very often, but if an administrator ever needs to boot anyone off the system, or boot everyone off the system - this is where they can go to do that.

## User Access Report

This list shows the number of times a user has logged into the system over a period of time (on the Total Logins tab). It also shows the total duration of the time they were logged in (Time Logged In Tab)
