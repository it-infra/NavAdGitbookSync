{% hint style="info" %}
Note that if the G/L code on the spreadsheet already exists in the system it will be overridden by the data on the imported spreadsheet. If the data does not exist, then the record will be created. Where a G/L Level does not already exist it will be created, it will be necessary to go into that level and enter the level description after the import.
