**Journal Entries**

1. Allowed to approve journal entries: If checked, all members of this group will be allowed to approve the journal entries which in turn will allow them to be posted. If not checked, users will be able to approve the journal entries which will remain in pending approval status and will not be posted to the general ledger.
2. Default New Journal Entries to Approved: If checked, new invoices will default to approved, unless otherwise setup.
3. Set Journal Import Reassign Journal IDs to Yes by Default: If checked, then whenever a user is importing journal entries, the system will automatically reassign an ID to each entry. If this is left unchecked, the system will not reassign an ID to each journal entry by default.

**Other Settings**

1. Display Cash In/Out Summary on G/L Home Page: If the box is checked, then the home page of G/L module will display a summary of cash in and cash out today, yesterday and for the last 30 days. There are hyperlinks for users to click and drill down into the cash details of the general ledger in and out.
2. Restrict Trial Balance & List Budgets Reports to Allowed G/L Code Groups (Remove the Company Selection): This option if checked, will allow only the users checked to have access the G/L account in the trial balance report, to view the report. Other users not assigned to the G/L account included in the trial balance report will not be able to view the report. If this option is unchecked, all users will be able to view the report for this G/L account.
