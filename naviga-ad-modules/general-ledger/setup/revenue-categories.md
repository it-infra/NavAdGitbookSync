See Also [A/R Client Ranking Reports](../../accounts-receivable-credit-control/reporting/#\_toc124065029-1)

Revenue Categories are defined under Setup -> Revenue Categories (in A/R or G/L modules)

Then they are linked to actual G/L codes in G/L Account Maintenance

Then they can be utilized as a filter in reporting in the A/R Client Ranking Reports.
