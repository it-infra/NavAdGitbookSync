# G/L Project Setup

G/L Projects can be setup and attached to A/P Invoice or Journal Entry Lines. They are carried through to the G/L when the Invoices or Journal Entries are posted to the G/L and then utilized in some reporting.

## Reports <a href="#_toc78298011" id="_toc78298011"></a>

The G/L Project ID is added as a reference to the G/L Detail when a Transaction is posted to G/L. As a result, reporting on G/L Details can be sorted and/or filtered based on the G/L Project ID. At the moment, this is limited to Trial Balance, G/L Transactions Report, and Informer Reports.
