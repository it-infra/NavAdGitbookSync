# Consolidated Financial Reports

User can create a group of consolidated reports and run these reports in a way that could compare the data in the different reports. Note that for the reports to work in the setup, the reports being compared must have the exact same number of lines; whichever one you add first; the system will not allow the next selections of reports unless their line count matches the first one. Each comparison report should have the exact same lines on it and in the same order for this to work correctly as intended. This is meant for accountants who have departmental reports and want to combine them into a single report.
