<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1482).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The columns are defined by the system, but the rows will be defined in your Financial Statement Report Setup.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1400).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Again, the columns are hard coded in the system, but you can customize the grouping on the rows however you would like. In this report, the number will display actuals for any past periods and budgets for the future periods. The dropdown report type in the top right allows you to change that behavior and select forecasts instead, or all budgets, or all actuals.

Selecting Actuals only for example will show 0's for the future periods:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1282).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On all the report bodies, hyperlinks for the details and/or figures per line are provided for further drill downs. Click one of the figures for drill down purpose. A new pop up screen displays with the data.

By default, the percentage calculation is based on the first line that a line totals into. For example, if a revenue line "Subscription Revenue" totals into a "Total Revenue" line then the calculated amount will be Subscription Revenue expressed as a percentage of the Total Revenue. This feature allows you to override the default behavior by instead basing the percentage calculation on a specific line on a report - defined here.
