This feature allows user to create report packages which are collections of financial reports. This screen lets an administrator setup report packages and define who can use them. To do so, administrator should first navigate to calculate the financial report, through the menu financial reports -> calculate the financial statement report. Enter the period to be calculated and click “calculate period”.

Navigate to the menu financial reports -> setup financial report packages. Click the + sign to add a new package. Enter the description, check the names of the users allowed to view the report and choose the report period. Check the buttons as needed for alternating color rows to make every row a different color in the report, check vertical borders, and horizontal borders if lines are needed around the report as a frame.
