# Proposals

## Enter/Update a Proposal

The options here will both take you to the Campaign Entry screen. Selecting to Enter/Update a proposal will take you to the campaign screen with the ability to search for an existing campaign or press the + to create a new campaign. Selecting Enter a new Proposal will assume that you want to create a new one and the search will be disabled and you will be all ready to just enter in a client name to start booking.

See [Creating Campaigns](../advertising/campaigns/creating-campaigns/#\_toc531451673) in Advertising Doc for information on creating a campaign header.

### Sending Campaign Proposals <a href="#_toc100152534" id="_toc100152534"></a>

You can send a Campaign (Quote Status) Proposal to the customer for signature approval. The Advertising Campaign order proposal/confirmation templates can be updated to include an order section for the Exhibition details AND you can now include the Exhibition order's Billing Schedule (since it will be billed separately in the Exhibition Module). Please note that the Merge Field Documentation includes these new fields as well.

The primary difference between adding an exhibition order to a Performance campaign vs a Flexible Campaign will come down to how it is billed. The actual order entry and proposal behavior will be the same.

If the Exhibition order is part of a performance campaign, then the billing takes place from within the Exhibition module as a separately billed item. In this case, the system utilizes the Exhibition Billing Schedule.

If the Exhibition order is part of a flexible campaign, then the billing takes place from within the Advertising Module using the campaign’s billing schedule. When you attach an Exhibition Order to a Flexible Campaign, it will pull the billing schedule from the Exhibition, according to the Exhibition Setup, onto the Campaign. This is valid only if the billing schedule on the Exhibition is based on percentages, not specific amounts.
