# Exhibition Code Tables

## Exhibitor Type <a href="#_toc9435401" id="_toc9435401"></a>

In the Exhibition module, navigate to the menu Setup -> Exhibition Code Tables Setup -> Exhibitor Type Setup. This table is used to indicate the type of Exhibitor, so that similar exhibitors can be grouped together. If Exhibitor Types will not be useful, set up one type which will be used in orders and no further action will be required.

Add an exhibitor type ID and then enter a description of the exhibitor type to represent a meaningful group of exhibitors. For example, enter a description of sponsor exhibitors which would include clients who sponsor the exhibition. When finished with each type, click on the + sign. Repeat the process as needed to enter all types of exhibitor groupings and click the + sign. Then when finished, click on the “Save” button.

## Directory Category <a href="#_toc9435402" id="_toc9435402"></a>

In the Exhibition module, navigate to the menu Setup -> Exhibition Code Tables Setup -> Directory Category. This is a category which user can utilize to organize a show’s directory listings. This information is used when entering a line item on an order and later reflect this information in the Directory Report.

Enter an ID for the category in the section “Create a Catalog Type” and enter a description of the category. Then click the + sign and click on “Save”.

## User Defined Fields <a href="#_toc9435404" id="_toc9435404"></a>

Click on the Exhibition User Defined Fields in the Exhibition Tables Codes Setup menu in order to setup the various UDFs. These are fields which you can customize to provide you with further details in an order line item if these fields are not available in Naviga Ad by default. For example, date fields such as approval dates, or text fields for “approved by” where the order entry user can enter free text of the approver’s name.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (21).png>)

You can also provide multi-select fields which would give entry user the opportunity to check multiple boxes of options in the order line item entry.

Some or all of these different UDFs can be assigned to each individual exhibition in the exhibition setup screen as needed. See [Opportunity User Defined Fields](../../crm/opportunities.md#\_toc122615685) for more information on setting up the various types of UDF's

## Space Adjustment Type <a href="#_toc9435405" id="_toc9435405"></a>

This type is used to identify adjustments that affect both the cost and size of a booth in an exhibition.

Navigate to the same Setup -> Exhibition Code Tables menu and click the Space Adjustment Type Setup and enter the space adjustment ID, descriptions and check the box if this is a positive space adjustment. This will result in an increase of size and cost in the order. If you leave it unchecked, this will be a negative adjustment of size and cost subtracted from the total space. Click the + sign and repeat the process to add more adjustment types. Then click on the save button.

## Order Cancellation Reasons <a href="#_toc9435409" id="_toc9435409"></a>

When a user cancels a reservation of a line item, the system will prompt the user to choose from the drop down list of reasons. For example the reasons could be user error, left show, moved to larger booth, moved to smaller booth, removed from show, booth change (us), booth change (them) and so forth.

Navigate to the menu setup -> Exhibition Codes Table Setup -> Cancellation Reason Setup.

## Registration Types

Registration Types are used for tracking budget/actual registrations per show. We don't take registrations in Naviga ad. That is typically handled by a 3rd party vendor like Cvent, but you can enter budgets and total revenue from Registrations to include with the event reporting inside Naviga Ad.
