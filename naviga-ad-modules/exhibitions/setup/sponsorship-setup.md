# Sponsorship setup

Unless you are already using this, Naviga advises against using this functionality.

If you are already using the Advertising Module, setting up a [Print Ad Product](../../../project-planning/naviga-ad-setup-detailed-training-agenda/product-setup.md#product-setup) for your sponsorship orders allows for much more flexibility and better functionality than what is available here.

If you are not using the Advertising Module for other items, then [Exhibition services](ratecards-services-adjustments.md#\_toc9435432) can be used in place of Sponsorship setup.
