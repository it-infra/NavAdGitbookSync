# Forms and Templates

## HTML Templates

These HTML Templates are used in the Exhibition module for Order Proposals and Confirmations. Similar to other forms, you will need to select create new on the left and then give this form a name and description. If this is to be used only a specific exhibition, select the exhibition in the dropdown. Otherwise, can be left blank to use for all shows.

Be sure to set active to "yes" to allow it to be used.

Click the button to see merge tags that are available to use in building the form.
