## Sponsorship Orders by Show

This report will display sponsorship orders for a given show.

Unless you are already using this, Naviga advises against using Exhibition Sponsorship functionality.

If you are already using the Advertising Module, setting up a [Print Ad Product](../../../project-planning/naviga-ad-setup-detailed-training-agenda/product-setup.md#product-setup) for your sponsorship orders allows for much more flexibility and better functionality than what is available in Exhibition Sponsorships.

If you are not using the Advertising Module, then [Exhibition services](../setup/ratecards-services-adjustments.md#\_toc9435432) can be also used in place of Sponsorships, again with more functionality over what is available in "sponsorships".
