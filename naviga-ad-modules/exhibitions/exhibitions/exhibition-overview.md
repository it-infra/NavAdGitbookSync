At the top of the screen, select the desired show from the Exhibition dropdown. If you are using the [Tracking Currency](../../advertising/setup/system-tables-setup-ad/currency-tracking.md) functionality, the show can be displayed in the local currency or any of the tracked foreign currencies as well. Select one or more options to view Confirmed/Reserved/Quoted orders to determine what to include/exclude in the numbers.

Profit / Loss section allows for a linked Production Job to be used to display the expenses on a show. Depending upon your group security, the Production job information, as well as the Budget information, may be hidden from view. The "Hide budget information on Exhibition Dashboard" setting controls this information

Pie charts display the breakdown in revenue by Registrations, Booths, Services, & Other and also Space breakdown between Sold and Unsold Space. The number are in the measurement set on the Exhibition setup screen (sq ft, sq yds or sq meters)

Next, Bar charts break down revenue vs target (and Budget if permissions allow for it) for Space revenue and Service Revenue.

The Confirmed Revenue Trend Comparison will compare the month by month confirmed orders for the months leading up to the show compared to what had been confirmed last year in the months leading up to the comparison show.

Next the revenue is broken down in a number of different ways: Space Types, Order Types, Status, Halls, Sections, etc.

And finally, the Exhibitors missing compared to the comparison show. This will list the accounts that were exhibitors as the last show, but have not yet booked for this year. A great sales tool to make sure you reach out to the missing exhibitors.
