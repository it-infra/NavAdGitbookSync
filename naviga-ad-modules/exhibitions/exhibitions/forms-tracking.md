# Forms Tracking

You, as the exhibition organizer, can create the form using Word Merge. For example the form can be a contract for the exhibition which the client exhibiting needs to sign and return to you, or a waiver form or insurance form and so forth. You can then assign the form to the exhibition and to the client’s orders. Then you can track the forms to see if and when they were sent out to the clients, if and when they were returned to you, and each order attached to the form for this exhibition.

### Create Form <a href="#_toc77934177" id="_toc77934177"></a>

Navigate to the menu Exhibitions -> Forms Tracking -> Word Merge Template. Click on “Create New”.

Choose the exhibition from the drop down menu for which you want to create this form. Enter a description for the form. You can then choose to select the browser setting for the date and number format or from the drop down menu, choose the format as applicable. For example, MM/DD/YYYY for the date format and so forth.

Click on the “Select” button, in order to browse and select the Word Merge Template which you already created as this form. Then click on the “Save” button.

### Setup Forms / Forms Maintenance <a href="#_toc77934178" id="_toc77934178"></a>

The form has to be created with a name that attaches it to a type of exhibitor that exists in the system. This will allow you to attach a form to the exhibition orders, and it gives the flexibility to have different forms for different exhibitor types.

Navigate to the menu Exhibitions -> Forms Tracking -> Setup Forms. Click the + sign and enter a form ID, description and then choose the exhibitor type from the drop down menu and click the + sign.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/4 (60).png>)

Repeat the process for any number of exhibitor types, and then click the “Save” button. At any later time, you can always mark a form as inactive, by choosing the form from the drop down menu and click on the no box for “Inactive” to set it to “Yes”. Then click on the “Save” button. This will prevent the form from appearing in other menus once the form is obsolete.

### Assign Forms to a Show <a href="#_toc77934179" id="_toc77934179"></a>

Not that you have created a form, and assigned it to exhibitor types, now it is time to assign the form to a show so the form can be tracked for each order in that exhibition.

Navigate to the menu Exhibitions -> Forms Tracking -> Assign Forms to a Show.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/5 (19).png>)

Choose the exhibition from the drop down menu and then enter under the section titled “Add a Form”, a number which determines the order of the forms appearing. For example, the form with the sort number 1 will appear before the one marked as 2, and so forth. If you change the sort at any time, make sure to click the button “Apply Sort” then “Save”. This will change the order of the forms appearing in this screen as well as others.

Choose the form from the drop down menu. Then choose the date from the pop up calendar of when to send out the form to clients and the deadline to return it to you.

Check the boxes for “Track Sent” and Track Returned” if you want the system to track these dates of the sending and return of the forms.

If there is a prerequisite form which needs to be returned first to you by the client before sending out this form, then choose that form from the drop down of prerequisites. Click the + sign to add the form. Repeat the process as needed to add all the forms to the list for this exhibition. Then click on the “Save” button.

Note that you can copy the existing forms in the system from another exhibition to this exhibition if they have the same required forms to be used. To do so, choose the exhibition from the drop down menu on this same screen. Then choose the exhibition to copy from in the other drop down menu. Then click the “Copy” button.
