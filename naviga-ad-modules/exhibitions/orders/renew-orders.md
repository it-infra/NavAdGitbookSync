# Renew Orders

## Running the renewal process

For a lot of folks, a show is an annual event with many of the same exhibitors there year after year. It is often easier to go ahead and renew all the orders from the prior year and then cancel the ones who don't want to renew rather than booking all new orders. This screen allows you to do just that.

The two on my list above that have red exclamation points at the end, cannot be renewed. When i hover over the exclamation point, it tells me why. These two, the booths are not valid on the new floorplan. So perhaps the layout has changed a bit due to a new venue or something like that. In my case, I was testing out merging booths together, splitting them, and deleting/renaming booths, so that is why i cannot renew those orders. But for the ones that can be renewed, I can select those rows and click on renew selected orders at the bottom.

I get a popup asking a couple questions on what to copy, and what status and billing schedule should be used.

Some will select to renew these as quotes and then send the quotes out to customers to renew them. Others will go straight to reserved....completely up to you and what works best in your workflow.

Once the orders are renewed, you can re-run the search with the box checked to Exclude orders Already renewed and you will see all the orders disappear from the list (in my case all were removed except the two that cannot be renewed). For those, i will simply book a new order manually for a different space.

Show Renewed To - Select the new show

Show Renewed From - Select the prior year show (or other show if it wasn't a prior year of the same show)

Count Matching Exhibitor/Division as Renewed - Yes/No Flag. When set to YES, orders which were not renewed, but do match Exhibition and Division in both shows will be added to the Renewed Orders Tab. When set to NO, these orders will be added to the Orders Not Renewed tab.

Renewed tab - this lists all the orders that WERE renewed from the prior show

Orders Not Renewed - this tab lists any orders that were in the past show, but were NOT renewed to the new show.

New Orders - this represents any NEW exhibitors who are in the current year, but were NOT in the prior show.

Regardless of the tab, each row, will have an expand option where you can expand to also see the details of the space(s) and service(s) ordered.

If working in multiple currencies, you can also toggle between viewing the numbers in the system currency (local currency) or in the currency in which it was billed.
