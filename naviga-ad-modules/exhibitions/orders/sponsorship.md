{% hint style="warning" %}
Unless you are already using this, Naviga advises against using this functionality. If desired, you can use menu security to hide it from user view.

If you are already using the Advertising Module, setting up a [Print Ad Product](../../../project-planning/naviga-ad-setup-detailed-training-agenda/product-setup.md#product-setup) for your sponsorship orders allows for much more flexibility and better functionality than what is available here.

If you are not using the Advertising Module for other items, then [Exhibition services](../setup/ratecards-services-adjustments.md#\_toc9435432) can be used in place of Sponsorship setup.
