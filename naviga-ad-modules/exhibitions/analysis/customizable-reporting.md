#### Selection Criteria

In the top box for Selection Criteria, there are many options for filters. Any selection criteria fields left blank will return ALL. It is recommended to choose at least one filter, and most common is the Order Date Range to/from. You can multi-select Exhibition(s) or leave that field blank for ALL and chose to exclude orders in a particular show with “NOT in Exhibition”. Also, some selection criteria filters offer for the field to be “Equal To” or alternately “NOT Equal To”.

#### More Selection Criteria

In the box for More Selection Criteria, you have the option to include or exclude particular Exhibitor clients or Services. The Filter Type can be set to “Equal To” to include only those selections or “NOT Equal To” to exclude only those selections.

#### Additional Filters

The Additional Filters box can be set to include or exclude ANY OTHER Exhibition Order field. This is where the report can get really fun! When you put your cursor in the Field ID box, a dropdown menu pops up to select any field you would like to use as a filter.

You can start typing the name of the field or scroll through the list of field names. The Operation column lets you set the field “Equal To” or “NOT Equal To” and then you have to type in the Criteria for that field you’re looking for. In addition, you can set these fields to include the fields “And/Or”. If you select “AND” then all criteria fields will have to be applicable all together. If you select “OR” then any of the fields will apply independently.

#### Field Selection

In the Field Selection box, you can choose the columns of data to display on the report and those fields can become a saved Field Template ID which makes it easy to re-run the same report with different criteria displaying the same columns of data. You can include or exclude just the Exhibition Space Reservation Orders, the Sponsorship Orders (not commonly used on the Digital First platform), or Services Orders.

At the bottom of this box, you can optionally Sort by or Group by any of the column fields selected. The Group By feature can work _almost_ like a pivot table. For more complex Pivots and groupings, you can also download the output to excel and then do your pivots and charts in excel.

Once you have setup various Field Templates, you can make your selections above, then choose the Field Template from the drop down menu. These Field Templates are shared with all users, not just the user who created the Template. So, it’s best to name the Field Template something that others will understand as well.

Once all of your desired selection criteria filters are chosen, you can click to Save Template on the first run of a newly created report. This will save the Field Template ID you just created above.

#### Run Report <a href="#_toc96595646" id="_toc96595646"></a>

Click Run Report.

The results will populate on the screen and you can choose to sort any columns or group any columns on screen. You can also click the Excel or PDF export buttons to download the results into an excel or PDF document.
