# Client / Rep Reports

## Exhibitor Ranking Report

Navigate to the Analysis menu -> Exhibitor Ranking Report.

Choose the date range for the report for which you would like to compare numbers. This selection will be considered to be the current year and the "Last Year" columns will be the prior year.

This report can be ranked by Exhibitor, Division or by Parent by choosing the ranking in the “Rank by” field.

Leave the Sales Rep field blank to see all, or select a rep to filter on only that reps customers/orders.

Select to see Net or Gross amounts

Check the boxes to “yes” to include the different statuses of orders in the report; for example, confirmed, reserved or quotes statuses.

Data can be filtered by partial character typing in the blank boxes at the top of the results grid.

This data is analyzed in the second tab of the results called “Product Adoption”. This tab provides information on how many clients are exhibiting in multiple shows. Calculations include the percentage of this year, last year and cumulative percentages and change from last year to this year of this ranking.

## Exhibitors by Exhibition Comparison

This report gives information about how many customers are repeat exhibitors in multiple shows. Select up to 4 shows at the top. This could be the same show across multiple years or it might be completely different shows but which might attract the same type of exhibitors.

A green box with a checkbox indicates that the exhibitor took part in that show. Red indicates that they did not participate. In the below example, I can see that many clients are there every year and some have been added on in recent years, and that once they start, they don't tend to leave....

## Rep Pipeline

The Rep Pipeline shows confirmed, reserved, and quoted orders by rep for any future shows. There are no filters on this report, so if reps shouldn't be allowed to see other reps pipelines, then consider hiding this report for regular users and only allow managers to see it. The next report, the Rep Summary, is filtered to show only the logged in rep, so that one might be more appropriate for regular reps.

## Rep Summary

The rep summary displays all orders for upcoming shows. This included Confirmed, reserved and quoted orders.

In the charts at the top, the Summary by Exhibition displays only Confirmed and Reserved orders, broken down by show. The Summary by status, show all future shows, broken down by status.

The details can be downloaded to excel or to pdf format, and the numbers in the report can be shown in the local (system) currency or in any of the configured [tracking currencies](../../advertising/setup/system-tables-setup-ad/currency-tracking.md).
