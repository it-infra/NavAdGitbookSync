## Deferred A/R Report

This report shows the deferred A/R details for the selected Exhibition and year.

The report gives the G/L account id and description, the order id, exhibitor, original deferred period, total deferred, the prior year billed amounts, and the twelve period amounts.

The total deferred column is the total amount of the order. Any time an invoice is created, the invoice amount will be entered in that month's column.

## Deferred Revenue Report

Similar to the Deferred A/R report above, but this is for the revenue.

The original deferral period will be when the order was billed, but the revenue itself will typically be the period of the show.
