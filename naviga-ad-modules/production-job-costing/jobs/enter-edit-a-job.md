<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (479).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The section "Email History" will detail what estimates were sent and when (and by whom)

## Approve Estimate

Once the estimates negotiations are over, select Approve from the dropdown list at the top of the screen, and enter the approver’s name. Then if you have created multiple estimates based on the back and forth negotiations with the customer, you can choose the final estimate to approve.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (858).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Scroll to the Approved Estimates pane and the system displays the estimates which you have marked as approved.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1134).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Use the expansion arrow for details display. Note the estimates of quantity, rate and final amount display. Initially the actuals and billed columns show zero values.

## Attachments

Note that you can click the drop-down and choose either “Link” and enter a URL or “File” browse to select a file to attach.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1448).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is to store any additional documents attached to this job and refer to them at any time. Click the + sign and repeat to add as many attachments as needed. You can always remove an attachment using the x icon corresponding to this attachment.

## Transaction Details

Once the estimates have been approved, scroll to the transaction details to enter the actuals.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (661).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can enter new time or new miscellaneous charges against this job. The notes you enter are viewable when you hover over the note icon.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (873).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you enter the number of hours, and choose the class code, the amount to charge is automatically calculated based on the previous setup.

You can also enter a miscellaneous charge, assign to a financial period, enter date of charge, and use the provided class codes from the drop-down menu.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (990).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Enter the amount to charge against the miscellaneous charge.

These amounts are reflected in the “Approved Estimates” section.

Note that when you enter a transaction, there is a naming convention to how the system creates the transaction IDs where it is a transaction with a Prefix - “I” = Internal charge, “M” = Misc. Charge, “T” = time charge.

### Transactions from A/P Invoices

User can attach an invoice to the job from the A/P module. Navigate to the A/P menu Invoice Entry screen and create a new invoice for a vendor.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (197).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the “Billable Job Costs” pane, choose the job ID you are working on, enter the Class ID and amount allocated to the invoice.

Post the A/P Invoice batch and return to the production module. Retrieve the job and this invoice displays on the job invoice pane.

## Job Link to Campaign <a href="#_toc66286699" id="_toc66286699"></a>

Jobs can be linked to a campaign ID to reflect the costs and budget on the campaign from the Job. The campaign budget reflects the Job ID as well. One campaign can have multiple jobs attached to it, but a job can have only one campaign attached to it.

If you plan to link Jobs to Campaigns for P\&L Analysis, as a pre-requisite, navigate to the menu Setup -> Admin -> System Parameters. Scroll to field #13 - “Campaign Expense Codes” and choose the option “Use Class Type Codes”. Save the settings.

Enter the details of a new job or edit an existing job and enter the campaign ID to link this job to in the “Linked Campaign ID”. The Linked Campaign Description is automatically defaulted in the field. Save the job. You can then proceed to add the details of this job.

Navigate to the AD module and search for the campaign to edit it. Click the node “Campaign Budget”. The screen contains the field Linked Job(s) which displays the Job ID. Note that a campaign can have more than one Job ID attached to it, but the reverse isn’t true. The Revenue, Expenses and Statement amounts in the Campaign Budget reflect the actual amounts from the Job.

## Close Job

Once the job is complete and has been billed and all the work done, you can close the job. Navigate to the screen and select Close this Job from the top right dropdown.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (791).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Optionally, additional to and cc recipients can be added as well. To made edits before sending, click the View/Edit document tab and make changes as needed.
