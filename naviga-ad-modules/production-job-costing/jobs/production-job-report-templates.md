# Production Job Report Templates

The Production Job Report Template allows users to share a job report with their client. For instructions on sending the report to a client see [Enter/Edit a Job](enter-edit-a-job.md#generate-job-report).

The Production Job Template report is similar to other templates elsewhere in Naviga Ad.
