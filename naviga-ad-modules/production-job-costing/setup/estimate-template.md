# Estimate Template

When creating a job, the user will create one or more estimates for their client. These estimates can be a Standard Estimate or a comparative Estimate (See [Enter/Edit a Job](../jobs/enter-edit-a-job.md#create-and-edit-estimate)). These estimates are based on a template created in Setup.

1. Navigate to the menu Setup -> Estimate Templates.
2.  Select "Create new" under either the Standard Estimates node or the Comparative estimate node.\\
