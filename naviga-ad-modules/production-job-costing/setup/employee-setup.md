# Employee Setup

Employees can be configured by navigating to Setup -> Employee Setup in the Production Module or Setup -> System Tables Setup -> Employee Setup in the Accounts Payable Module.

Employees are used in the Production module to assign employees to jobs and also for employees to log their time against a job so that it can get billed out to a client.
