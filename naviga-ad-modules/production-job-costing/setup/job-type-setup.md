# Job Type Setup

When creating a new Production Job, one of the items that a user must select is what type of job is this. Depending upon what job type is selected, certain user defined fields might be asked or required, and when creating an estimate, certain Class Codes might default onto the estimate.

To create a new Job Type, navigate to the menu Setup -> Job Type Setup.

1. Click on the “New” button to create a new type of job. This might be for example creating a video, website, social media or any production work which you want to track.
2. In the type dropdown select Production or Inventory to indicate the internal type for the job. (Inventory type Jobs are only used in the Naviga Book system and this field will be removed from Naviga Ad in a future release) For now, you will always select "Production" as the type.

3. The system provides you with user defined fields which apply to the type of job, which you can add from the drop-down button in the Assigned User Defined Fields pane, click the + sign to add it to the selected list.
4. Enter the default class codes which this job type typically uses. Choose them from the drop-down button and click the + sign.
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for all UDF's and Class Codes and save.
6. Repeat all steps until all needed Job Types are added.

## Job Cost Type UDF's

UDFs can be created ahead of time in the tree node “Job Cost Type User Defined Fields”. The system allows you to create different UDFs with different formats as needed. For example, you can create text, integers, multi-select options with check boxes or date format fields.

See Advertising Setup -> [User Defined Fields](../../advertising/setup/advertising-setup/user-defined-fields.md) if you need help creating the User Defined Fields. The concept is the same here as it is in other areas of the system.
