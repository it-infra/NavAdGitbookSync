# Department Setup

Departments can be setup by navigating to Setup -> Department Setup in the Production module or Setup -> System Tables Setup -> Department Setup in the Accounts Payable module.

Departments are linked to Employees in [Employee Setup](employee-setup.md).

To add a department, enter a code, a description, and a Salary G/L Account and click the + to add to the list. Repeat process for as many departements as is necessary.

Anything that has been used will display with a gray X and cannot be deleted. For any departments you no longer wish to use, can check the inactive box.
