## Production Jobs WIP Report

This menu under the Analysis menu provides you with a list of jobs which are still in progress and not finalized yet, by employee, start and end dates as well as due dates ranges. If you wish to also include Closed / Completed jobs, you can check the box to include closed jobs.

Drill down into the Job ID hyperlink for more study of the data.

These amounts on the report are derived directly from the tracking on each Project. Estimate is the sum of Estimates Amounts for all Class Codes.

Charges Received is the sum of Actual Costs from the Transaction Detail.

Charges Received = Billed to Client + Total WIP, so an Actual Cost is WIP until client is billed, and then it changes to Billed Cost.

Billed to Client is the sum of Billed Costs from the Transaction Detail.

Total WIP is the sum of WIP Costs from the Transaction Detail.

Note that Unposted Time displays on the Transaction Detail, but it might not display on the Approved Estimate shutter or in reporting.

Internal Costs are the Actual Costs for any Miscellaneous Transaction or Time Entry, i.e. excluding charges from Invoices. Zero values displaying are due to the Production Job Module Setup flag for “Update Cost of Sale on Internal Charges” being set to “NO” at the time the charge was entered.

## Production Job Notes Report

This report will display the internal notes from production jobs. Use the search criteria available at the top to find notes for desired customers, jobs, and/or dates. Can also leave this blank to find all, though depending on the quantity of jobs, that might produce more results than would be useful.

This list of notes is grouped by job by default, but that can be modified or removed if desired. Simply click the X on the job id in the light blue bar in the screenshot below. Drag and drop column headings into the blue bar area to add additional groupings.
