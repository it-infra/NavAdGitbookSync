## Customer Inquiry

In the Production module, navigate to Customers -> Customer Inquiry

This will take you to a seach screen to find an existing customer account. Search by Name at the top, or on the advanced search tab you can search by Name and many other fields. Can also search by a credit card (last 4-digits and card type) on the Search by Card Transaction tab.

Once search results are displayed click on the customer name or ID to open the Account Summary screen. Use the "History" tab to quickly select a recently accessed account (last 50 accounts displayed)

This search is the same as the Advertiser Inquiry Screen in the Advertising module, except that clicking on the account on the search results tab will direct you to the Accounting tab on the account screen rather than the CRM tab.

## Customer Maintenance

Navigate to Customers -> Customer Maintenance. This will direct you to the same screen as advertiser maintenance in the Advertising Module.

See also [Customers ](../accounts-receivable-credit-control/customers-a-r/#name-address-maintenance)in A/R Module and also in [Ad Module](../advertising/customers/advertiser-maintenance.md).
