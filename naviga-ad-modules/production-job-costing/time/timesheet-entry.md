# Timesheet Entry

For the times to be effective in the system, user must post the timesheets. Navigate to the menu Timesheets -> Timesheet Entry. The logged in user will be displayed in the Employee Field. The employee dropdown will only display yourself and any employees that you supervise. (See [Employee Setup](../setup/employee-setup.md))

* Click on “New Chargeable Time” and enter the job ID in the job id field.
* Enter the class code from the drop-down menu, the hours and the amount to charge is automatically calculated.
* Enter a note and continue to add more lines by clicking on “Add & New Line” or if you are finished, click on “Add Line”.
* Click on the “Save” button.

Repeat the process for any Inventory Jobs or any Non-Chargable Lines and then click save on the timesheet.

For any single job, a user can also post their time on the Transactions section of the job itself, but this is much more efficient if a user is working on several jobs throughout the day.
