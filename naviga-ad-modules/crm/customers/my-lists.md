# My Lists

My Lists provide a rep with a tool to help them target market their customers. Customers can be selected based on demographic information entered in CRM, purchasing information entered in any module or a combination of both. As part of the export process reps can narrow selection to certain individuals and can schedule to do items, update information or even create opportunities for all selected names on the list.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/8 (31).png>)

Enter the description at the top of the list - this is mandatory.

Choose one or more sales rep(s) by highlighting the name and clicking on the right arrow. The reps available in this list will be filtered based on the logged in user's User Security (Access Control settings)

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The way that this rep filter works is different from the "Ad List" or "Exhibitor List" sales rep selection. In this search it is based on customers that the selected user(s) have accessed. It can be further filtered below to show only "My Customers" or all the companies I have accessed. The reps who have accessed a particular customer is displayed here on the customer account:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the above example, I was logged into the system as Donna and I can see that both Donna and Kelly have worked with this account. So when the CRM-related "My List" is run for either of these users, this account will be displayed. But notice that logged in as Donna, the "Add to My Customers" star is not enabled, so it isn't considered to be one of her "My Customers" - so when Donna is the selected rep in the search, the Keswick Theatre will be returned in the search if "My Customers (below) is set to Select All Comanies, but it will not be returned in the search if "Select only companies in My Database" is selected.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1368).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The general filters section displays the filters as follows:

1. Record Types: You can choose all record types, advertisers only or agencies only.
2. My Customers: Choose all clients or only ones flagged as "my customer"
3. Favorites: Choose companies you marked as favorites or not your favorites depending on the data you want to focus on.
4. With Last Action: Select either companies with an action or without an action both as of a certain date and choose the date from the pop up calendar. (Useful if i want to pull a list of customers who have not been contacted in the last 90 days, or something similar)
5. With Contacts: Choose to include or exclude companies without contacts.

The portal filter section allows you to choose all companies, or companies with or without access to the portal.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/10 (7).png>)

You can also choose all clients or only ones who are allowed or not allowed to purchase remnant deals.

The opportunity filters section allows you to determine the companies who have opportunities in the system, choose the type and stage or stages of the opportunity.

The Geographic filter allows you to limit your list results to a certain location.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/12 (2).png>)

The category filters allow you to limit the choices to [category ](../setup/crm-system-settings.md#\_toc120632526)or several.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/13 (1).png>)

You can then add the products and/or exhibitions filters for this list by clicking the product and then the right arrow. (As this is the CRM list, this is filtering for customers tagged with these products/exhibitions in the "Interests" section on the account. To filter by customers who purchased these products/exhibitions, use the Ad List rather than the CRM List.)

You can then choose the different user defined fields to filter the data further and then when finished, click the “Save Criteria and Retrieve Data” button. The data will display on the “Results” bottom part of the screen.

Click “Return to My Lists”. This will display the new list on the My Lists screen.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/16 (4).png>)

You have the option to create a list B to compare to this list or just leave it as one list report.

* None: This means you have one list only list A as defined above.
* And: Select exhibitors in both List A and List B: This will display a comparison of exhibitors which are common to both lists only and exclude ones which are on one of the two lists.
* Or: Select exhibitions in either List A OR List B: Displays the exhibitions on either list even if there are common ones.

You have the option to merge two lists together if it makes business sense. The lists can be of different types, for example ad, CRM or exhibition lists.

To do so, click the button “New Merge List”.

You can now choose the two lists A and B from the drop down menus. Then you can choose the list to include only prospects which are on both lists, or merge all prospects whether they are on one or both lists, or select prospects which are on list A, but not on list B.

The second option to choose is whether to delete either list or leave them as is after the merge.

Once finished click the button “Create New List”.
