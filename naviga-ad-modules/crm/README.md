# CRM

The CRM module Home page will look a little different depending upon the role of the user. A regular Sales Rep type user will enter the CRM and see information about themselves. A Sales Manager type user will see information about the team/teams they are responsible for.

## Rep CRM Home

The tiles across the top for a regular rep are as follows:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CRMRepHome.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rep Home Screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Navigating the home screen shows the rep quite a lot of useful information about items needing their attention.

On the left of the screen is a convenient search bar to search for an account by name. The Last Customers list will show the 50 most recent accounts i have been in, so that i can quickly get back to them. If there are accounts that i am working with frequently, I can make them as favorites and they will be displayed under the star tab.

Along the right panel on the screen are a series of shutters which can be opened or closed and moved up/down on the page so that the information is displayed in the rep's desired order. Settings will be stored automatically against the user's login so that next time they return to this screen it will open the same way it was last displayed.

#### User Messages/Alerts

First in my view above is the User Messages/Alerts area. These are generally system generated messages, but can also contain manual alerts as well. Types of alerts you might see in here are as follows

* A sponsorship proposal with limited inventory has been created for multiple clients and not everyone will be able to purchase that inventory. As the inventory is getting low (as set up on the Product/position) the reps with open proposals will receive alerts.
* Similar to above but with Naviga Impression-based Inventory checking, rather than sponsorship checking.
* A client has approved a proposal or purchased an order through the Advertiser portal
* An Artist has sent a message about a material
* An account I created has been approved by finance
* A contact person has been added to one of my accounts

#### To Do's

Next on my screen above are the Rep To Do's. These might be tasks or meetings that the rep needs to do. As the To Do item becomes past the scheduled date, the date and time box will turn red. If it is still in the future it will display in green.

To update a to do, click on the Short Description to open the To Do window

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1387).png>)

Fill in desired fields. Action Type, Short Description, Priority and Date is required. For a new to do, tomorrow will be the default date, but that can be changed if desired. If you are configured to sync to outlook or gmail (Google suite), you may click the Sync icon to sync as a calendar entry in your email system. Sync can be defaulted to Yes depending upon the Action Type on the To Do. For example, you may choose to sync Appointments, but not phone calls/task type to do's.

If the To Do is now completed, click on the Completed Details at the bottom and fill in completion details. Optionally, once marked as complete, a followup To Do can be scheduled in the same window,

#### Proposals / Opportunities

The next window, on the proposals tab, a list of open proposals will be displayed as a reminder to the user of what proposals are currently outstanding. When the Camapign Start date on the proposal is within a week, the Date will turn yellow. When it is in the past, the date will turn red. When it is more than a week in the future, it will be green. Once the proposal status turns red, the rep can either edit the dates and re-send to the client if it is still a viable deal, or they can cancel it if desired.

The opportunities tab will show all opportunities with a future close date. Once the opportunity has passed its expected close date, it will disappear from this list. It can still be found though on the Opportunities navigation button.

#### Current Campaign Delivery

The final shutter on my screen above is to show the rep their current month's digital order lines and what the GAM fulfilment is looking like.

This will be displayed if the User Security for this user indicates that it should be displayed.

## CRM Manager Home Page

A Manager will come into the system and see activity and performance for the users who report to them. The manager will have the option to toggle between the manager view a regular rep view. The last navigation tile is the toggle between the two views. It will display "My CRM" when the other tiles are the manager tiles and will display "Manager" when the other tiles are the rep tiles.

Click on "My CRM" and the tiles will all change to those of a regular Sales Rep. That last tile then changes to a "Manager" tile and they can click that to toggle back to the manager view.

#### Rep Activity / Manager Home Screen

The manager's home screen will show the performance of their reps at the top of the screen.

Filters are displayed so that the manager can filter to just one Product or Product Group. The default is to show all. The Manager also can filter on Rep Group. If the Manager is in charge of multiple rep groups, they can be viewed one at a time, or all together.

By default, the starting period will be the beginning of the current year and the current period will be determined by today's date. These can be changed by selecting a different start date or current period in the dropdown.

The sales rep selection can be based on the rep on the brand or the rep on the order, depending on the selection in the Rep Selection dropdown.

Budgets can be based on the Product Budgets or the Format Budgets and they can be the original budget numbers or any one of 3 Forecast numbers. Setup for Budgets can be found in the [Advertising Module](../advertising/setup/sales-rep-setup-budgets.md#\_toc118884999).

Quotes can be displayed at full value or at weighted value based on the [Campaign Status Setup](../advertising/setup/advertising-setup/status-setup-campaign-status.md)

The bar chart below the filters shows each of the 12 months beyond the Start date selected. The blue number is the order value from Confirmed orders in that period and the gray bar is the budget for that period. This shows the total for all the reps in the filters chosen.

For individual rep views, scroll down to the next section. Here we see each rep in my rep group and their performance compared to actuals. The manager can see the budget in dark gray, the confirmed and reserved orders in green and the quotes as well in a light gray color. Any open opportunities are also displayed in shades of purple, based on the stage the opportunity is in.

There are tabs in this section for the Current Month Performance, for the Year through the current period Performance and a detailed 12 month performance

#### My Reps' Activity

Scrolling further down the page, the manager can see the activities the rep has been doing. This shows counts of activities. How many new actions have they created, how many completed, how many new notes, how many emails, and how many New Opps, New Proposals and Approved Proposals. Click on any of those numbers and get taken to a details screen to show the actual activities that make up that count.

Click on the rep's name and you will see the CRM screens as if you were that rep. This allows you to see their Home Page (including their alerts and tasks) to see what is on their agenda. It is another useful way to check up on if they are using the CRM.

#### Confirmed Sales by Rep

Next section Displays their confirmed orders. How much business have they closed in the last Week, Month, Qtr, Etc.

And then finally, the Rep's To Do's. This displays all their To Do's and the manager can open them, reassign them to someone else or move them to a different date. The To Do's can be viewed in a list or in a Calendar view.
