# Marketing Campaign Setup

Marketing Campaigns are used in the system in a couple of places. Depending on your system setup, this might not be actually labeled as "Marketing Campaign" - we had a request from a customer for this exact functionality, but they called it a "project code," so in CRM System Settings, the default name of "Marketing Campaign" can be overwritten.

Ultimately, if you are using Marketing Campaigns, the goal will be to end up with a marketing campaign linked to an Ad Campaign so that you can report on the revenue earned from your efforts and compare that to the expenses related to that Marketing Campaign.

## Creating a Marketing Campagin

To create a new marketing campaign, you must have at least an ID and a Short Description. To make it useful though, it is advisable to also enter a date range of when this campaign will be valid.

The long description can be used to add additional details about the Marketing Campaign.

The Target Revenue will be used in reporting to see how close you actually came to the goal. The Total Sales and Total cost are grayed out in the top section. The Total Sales field is a calculated field based on the total of the campaigns referencing this Marketing Campaign and the Total Cost is taken from the costs setup at the bottom of this setup screens.

The Opportunity Details section is relevant if you are using the Leads functionality. It sets the defaults for an opportunity if the lead is linked to this marketing campaign. See [Leads ](../leads.md#\_toc124153206)for more information.

Across the bottom are a series of tabs:

* Costs - This is where you will add any costs associated with this Marketing Campaign. Perhaps you sent a mailing, or had something printed up, or advertised this campaign somewhere that cost you some money. Enter any costs here and we will total it up at the top and also on the Marketing Campaign Performance Report.
*   Leads - If any leads are linked to this Marketing campaign, they will be listed here.\\
