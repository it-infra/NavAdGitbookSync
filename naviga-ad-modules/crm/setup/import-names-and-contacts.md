# Import Names and Contacts

## Name Import

With the CRM Name Import, a user can import any number of companies and individuals into the system to be used in conjunction with creating CRM opportunities and other CRM tasks (notes, actions, etc).

{% hint style="info" %}
This does NOT import _**advertisers**_ into System. To import advertisers to use like any other advertiser created from within System, use the Ad module Advertisers/Agencies Import function.
{% endhint %}

To import the contact name, you must enter the data in a separate row using the same company legacy ID and company information, but the TYPE on the contact row would be “I” instead of “C” for company.

To do so, navigate to the CRM module menu Setup -> Import Names and Contacts and then select the Import Names Node.

#### Duplicate Option

**Ignore Duplicate Clients -** if you include in the template a company legacy ID which exists in System the import will import them anyway and new names and contacts will be attached to the same existing company in System.

**Do Not Ignore Duplicate Clients -** the system will alert you if you have duplicate contacts with the same Individual Legacy ID or with the same Company Legacy ID for a client in the template as in System and will not import them.

**Create Opportunities for Duplicate Clients -** This allows the system to create opportunities for the clients in the template sheet but importing them as new clients with new IDs, even if they happen to have the same legacy ID in the template as ones already in the System system. The sheet has to have been marked with Y in the “Create Opportunity” column in the template, so when you log into CRM, the opportunities list will contain new opportunities for them.

U**pdate existing clients** - The import will update the existing client with the data in the import template related to this advertiser. The rules on update are as follows:

* Null fields will be ignored in the update
* To DELETE existing data - there should be a space in the field
  * deletes ALL values in multivalued fields
* Single valued fields are always replace
* Multi value always append

#### Company Selection for Contact

This selection has two options:

1. **Company ID is the Elan Name ID:** If selected, then the Company ID entered in the template is the same ID as in System.
2. **Use the Legacy ID to Derive the Elan Name ID:** If selected then the Company ID in the template is the Legacy ID for the company which will match system Company ID.

### Import UDFs and Demographics to Existing Advertiser <a href="#_toc534988035" id="_toc534988035"></a>

User can import UDFs and demographics for an existing company or individual. This same import allows for linking the Salesrep to a customer. This allocates the rep to this client and places the client to the rep’s database. If the client has a Salesrep already assigned to them, this import will add this imported Salesrep to the list of reps assigned to the client and will not remove the original rep.
